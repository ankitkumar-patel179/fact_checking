These accords put an end to the three-and-a-half-year-long Bosnian War, which was part of the much larger Yugoslav Wars.. The warring parties agreed to peace and to a single sovereign state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of two parts, the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and mainly Croat-Bosniak-populated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.. The agreement has been criticized for creating ineffective and unwieldy political structures and entrenching the ethnic cleansing of the previous war.[3][4]. Though basic elements of the Dayton Agreement were proposed in international talks as early as 1992,[5] these negotiations were initiated following the unsuccessful previous peace efforts and arrangements, the August 1995 Croatian military Operation Storm and its aftermath, the government military offensive against the Republika Srpska, conducted in parallel with NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.

Observation 1: Christopher Columbus[b] (/kəˈlʌmbəs/;[2] between 25 August and 31 October 1451 – 20 May 1506) was an Italian[c] explorer and navigator from the Republic of Genoa who completed four Spanish-based voyages across the Atlantic Ocean sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs, opening the way for the widespread European exploration and European colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America.. The name Christopher Columbus is the anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus. Growing up on the coast of Liguria, he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, who bore a son Diego, and was based in Lisbon for several years.

Following the  Indian Independence in 1947—the Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after a police action.

Action 1: Search[The Renaissance]
Observation 1: The Renaissance (UK: /rɪˈneɪsəns/ rin-AY-sənss, US: /ˈrɛnəsɑːns/ ⓘ REN-ə-sahnss)[1][a] is a period in history and a cultural movement marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity, covering the 15th and 16th centuries and characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity; it occurred after the crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change in most fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration and science. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a ""long Renaissance"" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.[3]. The traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance's early modern aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.[4][5] The beginnings of the period—the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300—overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c. 1350–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.. The Renaissance's intellectual basis was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""man is the measure of all things"". Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete.
Thought 2: The observation mentions that the Renaissance is associated with great social change in various fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration, and science. It also talks about the Renaissance's intellectual basis, which was derived from the concept of humanism and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy. These evidences support the claim that the Renaissance is known for its cultural developments. Thus, the claim is supported by the evidence."

Characterized by his nasal tenor and occasional bass-baritone singing, Love has been one of the band's vocalists and lyricists for their entire career, contributing to each of their studio albums and serving as their frontman for live performances. During the mid-1960s, he was one of Brian's main collaborators, contributing lyrics to hit records such as ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" (1964), ""I Get Around"" (1964), ""Help Me, Rhonda"" (1965), ""California Girls"" (1965), and ""Good Vibrations"" (1966).. Drawing inspiration from Chuck Berry and Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, Love's lyrics primarily reflected the youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, which helped fashion pop culture's perception of the ""California Dream"".[1]  Love also had a significant role in the Beach Boys' vocal arrangements – particularly the doo-wop element in their sound. Starting in 1968, Love was a student of Transcendental Meditation (TM) under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and became a TM teacher in 1971.
Thought 2: According to the evidence, Mike Love did co-found a band. It states that he co-founded the Beach Boys with his cousins and a friend. Therefore, the claim is indeed supported by the evidence."

The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland; as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley, the Dandenong Ranges, and the Macedon Ranges. Melbourne has a population over 5 million (19% of the population of Australia, as of the 2021 census), mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its inhabitants are commonly referred to as ""Melburnians"".[note 2]. The area of Melbourne has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans.[16][17] Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land encompassing Melbourne are the Boonwurrung, Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples. A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip, then part of the British colony of New South Wales, in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), that Melbourne was founded.[16] It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837, and named after the then British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne.[16] In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria.[18] During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises.[19][20] After the federation of Australia in 1901, it served as the interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927.[21] Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 32nd globally in the March 2022 Global Financial Centres Index.[22].
Thought 2: The observation clearly states that Melbourne is the capital of the Australian state of Victoria and the second-most populous city in Australia. It also mentions its location in the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and its surroundings like the Mornington Peninsula and the Yarra Valley.

All other members have joined the organization as a result of negotiation, and membership consists of a balance of rights and obligations.[2] The process of becoming a World Trade Organization (WTO) member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country's stage of economic development and the current trade regime.[3]. An offer of accession is given once consensus is reached among members.[4] The process takes about five years, on average, but it can take some countries almost a decade if the country is less than fully committed to the process, or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of Kyrgyzstan, lasting 2 years and 10 months.

The party's main ideology was Marxism-Leninism.. The party started in 1898 as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1903, that party split into a Menshevik (minority) and Bolshevik (majority) faction; the latter, led by Vladimir Lenin, is the direct ancestor of the CPSU and is the party that seized power in the October Revolution of 1917.

As children in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of shifting societal values, Gen Xers were sometimes called the ""latchkey generation,"" which stems from their returning as children to an empty home and needing to use the door key. This was a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home..

In 1979, he was featured on Karen Carpenter's solo album as a backing vocalist on the track ""Making Love In The Afternoon"" an album that wouldn't be released until the early 1990s by A&M Records.. As a solo artist, Cetera has scored six Top 40 singles, including two that reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart in 1986, ""Glory of Love"" and ""The Next Time I Fall"".[10] ""Glory of Love"", the theme song from the film The Karate Kid Part II (1986), was co-written by Cetera, David Foster and Diane Nini and was nominated for both an Academy Award[11] and a Golden Globe Award for best original song from a motion picture.[12] In 1987, Cetera received an ASCAP award for ""Glory of Love"" in the category ""Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures"".[13] His performance on ""Glory of Love"" was nominated for a Grammy Award for best pop male vocal.[14] That same year Cetera and Amy Grant, who performed as a duet on ""The Next Time I Fall"", were nominated for a Grammy Award for best vocal performance by a pop duo or group.[14]. Besides David Foster and Amy Grant, Cetera has collaborated throughout his career with other nationally and internationally known recording artists from various genres of music.
Thought 2: From the observation, it is clear that Peter Cetera is described as a musician, frontman, vocalist, and bassist for the American rock band Chicago. It is also mentioned that he has released solo studio albums and scored Top 40 singles, including two number one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Therefore, the claim that Peter Cetera was an artist is supported by the evidence."

Thought 1: I need to search International Relations and find if it includes all the mentioned subjects.
Action 1: Search[International Relations]
Observation 1: International relations (IR) are the interactions among sovereign states. The scientific study of those interactions is also referred to as international studies, international politics,[2] or international affairs.[3] In a broader sense, the study of IR, in addition to multilateral relations, concerns all activities among states—such as war, diplomacy, trade, and foreign policy—as well as relations with and among other international actors, such as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), international legal bodies, and multinational corporations (MNCs).[4][5] There are several schools of thought within IR, of which the most prominent are realism, liberalism, and constructivism.. International relations is widely classified as a major subdiscipline of political science, along with comparative politics, political theory, political methodology, and public administration.[6][7] It also often draws heavily from other fields, including anthropology, economics, geography, law, philosophy, sociology, and history.[8]. While international politics has been analyzed since antiquity, international relations did not become a discrete field until 1919, when it was first offered as an undergraduate major by Aberystwyth University in the United Kingdom.[6][9] After the Second World War, international relations burgeoned in both importance and scholarship—particularly in North America and Western Europe—partly in response to the geostrategic concerns of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent rise of globalization in the late 20th century presaged new theories and evaluations of the rapidly changing international system.[10].
Thought 2: The observation mentions that the study of International Relations draws heavily from fields such as anthropology, economics, geography, law, philosophy, sociology, and history. It also mentions that international relations concerns activities among states and other international actors such as intergovernmental organizations and multinational corporations. Since the claim includes subjects like communication studies, psychology, gender studies, cultural studies, and more, which are not explicitly mentioned in the observation, there is not enough information to support or refute the claim. The evidence does show that International Relations includes a broad range of subjects, but it does not specifically list all the subjects mentioned in the claim. So, the evidence is not sufficient to verify the claim."

He is widely regarded as one of the most iconic Chinese film stars and one of the most renowned martial arts stars of his generation.[3][4]. After three years of training with acclaimed Wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team. Between 1974 and 1979, he won the title of Men's All-Around National Wushu Champion five times.[5] After retiring from competitive Wushu at age 18, Li went on to win great acclaim in China as an actor, making his debut with the film Shaolin Temple (1982), which instantly catapulted him to stardom in East Asia.[6] He went on to star in many critically acclaimed films, most notably as the lead in Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002), Fist of Legend (1994), the first three films in the Once Upon a Time in China series (1991–1993), in which he portrayed folk hero Wong Fei-hung, and Fearless (2006), which is loosely based on the life of Huo Yuanjia. His movie career in China is credited with reviving Wushu in Hong Kong martial arts films during the 1990s,[5] and revitalising the Shaolin Temple.[7] Li is also  noted for his contribution to making new Wuxia films popular internationally during his career.[8].
Thought 2: Based on the evidence, it states that Jet Li retired from competitive Wushu at age 18. Since 18 is less than 19, it is reasonable to claim that Jet Li retired from Wushu at an age after 19. Thus, the claim is supported by the evidence."

Each of Cole's studio albums would peak the US Billboard 200 upon release, beginning with his debut Cole World: The Sideline Story (2011) and its follow up, Born Sinner (2013). The albums would receive critical acclaim and spawn hit singles including ""Work Out"", ""Power Trip"" (featuring Miguel), and ""Crooked Smile"" (featuring TLC), each charting within the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.[5] Despite commercial success, Cole would depart from the pop-oriented sound of his first two records in favor of conscious subject matter for his subsequent projects; themes of nostalgia, racial inequality, and materialism would be explored respectively in his subsequent releases: 2014 Forest Hills Drive (2014), 4 Your Eyez Only (2017) and KOD (2018).

Unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) charged with using excessive force in the arrest and beating of Rodney King. The incident had been videotaped by George Holliday, who was a bystander to the incident, and was heavily broadcast in news and media outlets.. The rioting took place in several areas in the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over six days following the verdict's announcement. Widespread looting, assault, and arson occurred during the riots, which local police forces had difficulty controlling.
Thought 2: The observation states that the 1992 Los Angeles riots were indeed a series of riots and civil disturbances that occurred in Los Angeles County. So, the claim is indeed supported by the evidence."

Thought 2: From suggestions, I should search ""Silk Road"" to find more information about it.
Action 2: Search[Silk Road]
Observation 2: The Silk Road (Chinese: 絲綢之路)[1] was a network of Eurasian trade routes active from the second century BCE until the mid-15th century.[2] Spanning over 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles), it played a central role in facilitating economic, cultural, political, and religious interactions between the East and West.[3][4][5] The name ""Silk Road"", first coined in the late 19th century, has fallen into disuse among some modern historians in favor of Silk Routes, on the grounds that it more accurately describes the intricate web of land and sea routes connecting Central, East, South, Southeast, and West Asia, East Africa, and Southern Europe.[2]. The Silk Road derives its name from the highly lucrative trade of silk textiles that were produced almost exclusively in China. The network began with the Han dynasty's expansion into Central Asia around 114 BCE through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy Zhang Qian, which brought the region under unified control. The Parthian Empire provided a bridge to East Africa and the Mediterranean. By the early first century CE, Chinese silk was widely sought-after in Rome, Egypt, and Greece.[2] Other lucrative commodities from the East included tea, dyes, perfumes, and porcelain; among Western exports were horses, camels, honey, wine, and gold.
Thought 3: The observation mentions that silk textiles were highly lucrative and produced almost exclusively in China, and that the Silk Road derives its name from the trade of silk textiles. This suggests that silk scarves may have been a major trade item on the Silk Road. However, the observation does not explicitly state that silk scarves were the major trade item, so the evidence is not sufficient to support the claim. Therefore, the claim does not have enough information."

He entered the comics field two years later, in 1936, freelancing original material to editor Jerry Iger's comic book Wow, What a Magazine!, including his first pencil and ink work on the serial Hiram Hick.[8] The following year, Kane began to work at Iger's subsequent studio, Eisner & Iger, which was one of the first comic book ""packagers"" that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium during its late-1930s and 1940s Golden Age. Among his work there was the talking animal feature ""Peter Pupp""—which belied its look with overtones of ""mystery and menace""[8]—published in the U.K.
Thought 3: The search for Bob Kane only provided information about his career as a comic book writer and artist, but it did not mention anything about the Joker's design or his claim of responsibility for it.

Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.. Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and of making political commentary.

Action 1: Search[mixtape]
Observation 1: A mixtape (alternatively mix-tape, mix tape or mixed tape) is a compilation of music, typically from multiple sources, recorded onto a medium. With origins in the 1980s, the term normally describes a homemade compilation of music onto a cassette tape, CD, or digital playlist. The songs are either ordered sequentially or made into a continuous programme by beatmatching the songs and creating seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings with fades or abrupt edits.[1] Essayist Geoffrey O'Brien described this definition of the mixtape as ""perhaps the most widely practiced American art form"".[2][3]. In hip hop and R&B culture, a mixtape often describes a self-produced or independently released album issued free of charge to gain publicity or avoid possible copyright infringement. However, the term has been applied to a number of releases published for profit in the 2010s, and the line between a release billed as a mixtape and one referred to as a studio album or extended play has become increasingly blurred..
Thought 2: According to the observation, a mixtape can now be recorded onto a CD or digital playlist. This supports the claim that a mixtape is now recorded onto CDs or MP3 playlists. So, the claim is indeed supported by the evidence."

For playing Antonius Proximo, the old, gruff gladiator trainer in Ridley Scott's Gladiator, in what was his final film, Reed was posthumously nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 2000. At the peak of his career, in 1971, British exhibitors voted Reed fifth-most-popular star at the box office.[1] The British Film Institute (BFI) stated that ""partnerships with Michael Winner and Ken Russell in the mid-[19]60s saw Reed become an emblematic Brit-flick icon"", but from the mid-1970s his alcoholism began affecting his career, with the BFI adding: ""Reed had assumed Robert Newton's mantle as Britain's thirstiest thespian"".[2]. Robert Oliver Reed was born on 13 February 1938 at 9 Durrington Park Road,[3] Wimbledon, southwest London, to Peter Reed, a sports journalist, and Marcia (née Napier-Andrews).[4] He was the nephew of film director Sir Carol Reed, and grandson of the actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his mistress, Beatrice May Pinney (who later assumed the name 'Reed'),[5] she being ""the only person who understood, listened to, encouraged and kissed Oliver"".[6] Reed claimed to have been a descendant (through an illegitimate step) of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia.[7] Reed attended 14 schools,[8] including Ewell Castle School in Surrey.
Thought 2: The observation states that Oliver Reed was an English actor known for his notable films. So, the claim that Oliver Reed was an actor is indeed supported by the evidence."

Action 1: Search[Vitamin B12]
Observation 1: Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin involved in metabolism.[2] It is one of eight B vitamins. It is required by animals, which use it as a cofactor in DNA synthesis, and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism.[3] It is important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin, and in the circulatory system in the maturation of red blood cells in the bone marrow.[2][4] Plants do not need cobalamin and carry out the reactions with enzymes that are not dependent on it.[5]. Vitamin B12 is the most chemically complex of all vitamins,[6] and for humans, the only vitamin that must be sourced from animal-derived foods or from supplements.[2][7] Only some archaea and bacteria can synthesize vitamin B12.[8] Most people in developed countries[failed verification] get enough B12 from the consumption of meat or foods with animal sources.[2] Foods containing vitamin B12 include meat, clams, liver, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products.[2] Many breakfast cereals are fortified with the vitamin.[2] Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent vitamin B12 deficiency.[2] They are taken by mouth, but for the treatment of deficiency may also be given as an intramuscular injection.[2][6]. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in developed countries is impaired absorption due to a loss of gastric intrinsic factor (IF) which must be bound to a food-source of B12 in order for absorption to occur.[9] A second major cause is age-related decline in stomach acid production (achlorhydria), because acid exposure frees protein-bound vitamin.[10] For the same reason, people on long-term antacid therapy, using proton-pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or other antacids are at increased risk.[11] The diets of vegetarians and vegans may not provide sufficient B12 unless a dietary supplement is consumed. A deficiency in vitamin B12 may be characterized by limb neuropathy or a blood disorder called pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia, causing a feeling of tiredness and weakness, lightheadedness, headache, breathlessness, loss of appetite, abnormal sensations, changes in mobility, severe joint pain, muscle weakness, memory problems, decreased level of consciousness, brain fog, and many others.[12] If left untreated in infants, deficiency may lead to neurological damage and anemia.[2] Folate levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B12 deficiency..
Thought 2: The observation states that Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin involved in metabolism and is required by animals as a cofactor in DNA synthesis and fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. It plays a vital role in the normal functioning of the nervous system and the circulatory system. The observation also mentions that Vitamin B12 is the most chemically complex of all vitamins and must be sourced from animal-derived foods or supplements. It is clear from the evidence that Vitamin B12 is indeed an organic compound and vital nutrient. So, the claim is supported."

Lilith appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and localities[4] that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Baba Bathra 73a), in the Book of Adam and Eve as Adam's first wife, and in the Zohar Leviticus 19a as ""a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man"".[5] Many traditional rabbinic authorities, including Maimonides and Menachem Meiri, reject the existence of Lilith.[6].

Thought 2: From the suggestions, I should search ""Parliamentary system"". 
Action 2: Search[Parliamentary system]
Observation 2: A parliamentary system, or parliamentarian democracy, is a system of democratic governance of a state (or subordinate entity) where the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the support (""confidence"") of the legislature, typically a parliament, to which it is accountable. In a parliamentary system, the head of state is usually a person distinct from the head of government. This is in contrast to a presidential system, where the head of state often is also the head of government and, most importantly, where the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.. Countries with parliamentary systems may be constitutional monarchies, where a monarch is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of parliament, or parliamentary republics, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature. In a few parliamentary republics, among some others, the head of government is also head of state, but is elected by and is answerable to parliament.
Thought 3: The observation says that a parliamentary system is a system of democratic governance where the executive derives its legitimacy from the support of the legislature. It also mentions that in a parliamentary system, the head of state is usually a person distinct from the head of government. From this information, it can be inferred that the United Kingdom does have a parliamentary system, as it has a separate head of state (monarch) and head of government (Prime Minister) and the executive derives its legitimacy from the support of the legislature (Parliament). Therefore, the claim is indeed refuted by the evidence."

They eat small crustaceans, including crabs, hermit crabs, shrimp, and other small sea animals.. They are one of the world's most venomous marine animals.[3] Despite their small size—12 to 20 cm (5 to 8 in)—and relatively docile nature, they are very dangerous to humans if provoked when handled because their venom contains a powerful neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin.. The species tends to have a lifespan of approximately two to three years. This may vary depending on factors such as nutrition, temperature, and the intensity of light within its environment..

Thus far, at least five different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of ""the Speed Force""—have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC's history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951, 1961–2011, 2017–present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry's nephew Wally West (1986–2011, 2016–present), Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007), and Chinese-American Avery Ho (2017–present).

The State of Medina is considered to be the first Islamic State and the precursor to the Rashidun Caliphate.. The Islamic prophet Muhammad had been invited to Medina by city leaders to adjudicate disputes between clans from which the city suffered.[2] He left Medina to return to and conquer Mecca in December 629.. A delegation from Medina, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community.[2][3] There was fighting in Yathrib (Medina) mainly involving its Arab and Jewish inhabitants for around a hundred years before 620.[2] The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the battle of Bu'ath in which all the clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood-feud and an eye for an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.[2] The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.[4]. Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina until virtually all of his followers had left Mecca.
Thought 3: The observation states that Muhammad ""came to the city of Medina following the migration of his followers in what is known as the Hijrah"" and that ""Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina."" This indicates that Muhammad did indeed migrate from Mecca to Medina. Therefore, the claim is refuted by the evidence."

Action 2: Search[History of Istanbul]
Observation 2: Neolithic artifacts, uncovered by archeologists at the beginning of the 21st century, indicate that Istanbul's historic peninsula was settled as far back as the 6th millennium BCE.[1] That early settlement, important in the spread of the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe, lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by rising water levels.[2][3][4] The first human settlement on the Asian side, the Fikirtepe mound, is from the Copper Age period, with artifacts dating from 5500 to 3500 BCE.[5] In the European side, near the point of the peninsula (Sarayburnu) there was a settlement during the early 1st millennium BCE. Modern authors have linked it to the possible Thracian toponym Lygos,[6] mentioned by Pliny the Elder as an earlier name for the site of Byzantium.[7]. There is evidence suggesting there were settlements around the region dating as far back as 6700 BC, and it is hard to define if there was any settlement on exact spot at city proper established, but earliest records about city proper begins around 660 BC[a][13][14] when Greek settlers from Megara colonized the area and established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus. It fell to the Roman Republic in 196 BC,[15] and was known as Byzantium in Latin until 330, when the city, soon renamed as Constantinople, became the new capital of the Roman Empire. During the reign of Justinian I, the city rose to be the largest in the western world, with a population peaking at close to half a million people.[16] Constantinople functioned as the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which effectively ended with the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
Thought 3: The observation mentions that Byzantium was established on the European side of the Bosphorus, which later became Constantinople, the capital of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. However, it does not explicitly state that Istanbul itself was founded by Byzantion. Based on the evidence, it is unclear if Istanbul was founded by Byzantion or if Byzantion was simply a settlement within the broader history of Istanbul.

The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios: domestic family drama, and a misanthropic grandfather dragging his grandson into hijinks.. Roiland voiced the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family.

In the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal. Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]. Beijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world.
Thought 2: The observation states that Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China and is the world's most populous national capital city. It also mentions that Beijing is governed as a municipality and is one of the largest cities in China. Therefore, the claim that Beijing is a city is supported by the evidence."

Observation 1: Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; born Lee Jun-fan, 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor whose career spanned Hong Kong and the United States.[3][4][5] He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is sometimes credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA).[6] Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[7]. Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. However, these were not martial arts films. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights).
Thought 2: The observation states that Bruce Lee was not only a professional martial artist, but also an actor. It mentions that he was an actor in both Hong Kong and the United States, and that he is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and changing the way Chinese people were presented in American films.

Vitamin B12 is the most chemically complex of all vitamins,[6] and for humans, the only vitamin that must be sourced from animal-derived foods or from supplements.[2][7] Only some archaea and bacteria can synthesize vitamin B12.[8] Most people in developed countries[failed verification] get enough B12 from the consumption of meat or foods with animal sources.[2] Foods containing vitamin B12 include meat, clams, liver, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products.[2] Many breakfast cereals are fortified with the vitamin.[2] Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent vitamin B12 deficiency.[2] They are taken by mouth, but for the treatment of deficiency may also be given as an intramuscular injection.[2][6]. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in developed countries is impaired absorption due to a loss of gastric intrinsic factor (IF) which must be bound to a food-source of B12 in order for absorption to occur.[9] A second major cause is age-related decline in stomach acid production (achlorhydria), because acid exposure frees protein-bound vitamin.[10] For the same reason, people on long-term antacid therapy, using proton-pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or other antacids are at increased risk.[11] The diets of vegetarians and vegans may not provide sufficient B12 unless a dietary supplement is consumed. A deficiency in vitamin B12 may be characterized by limb neuropathy or a blood disorder called pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia, causing a feeling of tiredness and weakness, lightheadedness, headache, breathlessness, loss of appetite, abnormal sensations, changes in mobility, severe joint pain, muscle weakness, memory problems, decreased level of consciousness, brain fog, and many others.[12] If left untreated in infants, deficiency may lead to neurological damage and anemia.[2] Folate levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B12 deficiency..
Thought 2: The observation states that ""Plants do not need cobalamin and carry out the reactions with enzymes that are not dependent on it."" This suggests that plants do not produce Vitamin B12. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence."

As a professional wrestler, he is best remembered for his widely panned 2000 stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and headlined the Slamboree pay-per-view event; he would later receive praise for his work on the independent wrestling circuit.[5]. A member of the Arquette acting family, he first became known during the mid-1990s after starring in several Hollywood films aside from the Scream franchise, such as Wild Bill, Never Been Kissed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, See Spot Run and Eight Legged Freaks. He has since had several television roles, such as Jason Ventress on ABC's In Case of Emergency.

The G7 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.[4].

Action 1: Search[Renaissance art]
Observation 1: Renaissance art (1350 – 1620 AD[1]) is the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the period of European history known as the Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, science, and technology. Renaissance art took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. For art historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.. The body of art, including painting, sculpture, architecture, music and literature identified as ""Renaissance art"" was primarily produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man.
Thought 2: The observation states that Renaissance art is the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the period of European history known as the Renaissance. It also mentions that Renaissance art marks the transition from the medieval period to the Early Modern age. Since art involves the creation of paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts, and the claim mentions that Renaissance art involved an artist, the evidence supports the claim.

Observation 1: The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws introduced in the Southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that enforced  racial segregation, ""Jim Crow"" being a pejorative term for an African American.[1] Such laws remained in force until 1965.[2] Formal and informal segregation policies were present in other areas of the United States as well, even if several states outside the South had banned discrimination in public accommodations and voting.[3][4] Southern laws were enacted by white ""Redeemers""-dominated state legislatures to disenfranchise and remove political and economic gains made by African Americans during the Reconstruction era.[5]  Such continuing racial segregation was also supported by the successful Lily-White Movement of Southern Republicans.[6]. In practice, Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America and in some others, beginning in the 1870s. Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, in which the Supreme Court laid out its ""separate but equal"" legal doctrine concerning facilities for African Americans. Moreover, public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War in 1861–1865.
Thought 2: The observation states that the Jim Crow laws were state and local laws introduced in the Southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that enforced racial segregation. It also mentions that such laws remained in force until 1965. Therefore, the claim that in America, the Jim Crow laws were in effect is supported by the evidence."

Observation 1: VHS (short for Video Home System)[1][2][3] is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes invented in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan and was the competitor to the ill-fated Sony Betamax system. Originally VHS was an initialism for Vertical Helical Scan (a reference to the recording system used) but was later changed to the more consumer-friendly Video Home System.[4]. Magnetic tape video recording was adopted by the television industry in the 1950s in the form of the first commercialized video tape recorders (VTRs), but the devices were expensive and used only in professional environments. In the 1970s, videotape technology became affordable for home use and widespread adoption of videocassette recorders (VCRs) began, largely as a means for television viewers to watch programming at more convenient times or more than once.[5]. In the later 1970s and early 80s, the home video industry experienced a ""format war"" between incompatible tape standards backed by competing technology companies.
Thought 2: The observation does not mention the specific release date of VHS in Japan. It only mentions that VHS was invented in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan. Since there is no evidence to support or refute the claim, it is concluded that there is not enough information to verify the claim."

Action 1: Search[Empathy]
Observation 1: Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.[1] Definitions of empathy encompass a broad range of social, cognitive, and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others (and others' emotions in particular). Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional (or affective) empathy, somatic empathy, and spiritual empathy.[2]. The English word empathy is derived from the Ancient Greek ἐμπάθεια (empatheia, meaning ""physical affection or passion"").[3] That word derives from ἐν (en, ""in, at"") and πάθος (pathos, ""passion"" or ""suffering"").[4] Theodor Lipps adapted the German aesthetic term Einfühlung (""feeling into"") to psychology in 1903,[5]: ch. 1  and Edward B. Titchener translated Einfühlung into English as ""empathy"" in 1909.[6] In modern Greek εμπάθεια may mean, depending on context, prejudice, malevolence, malice, or hatred.[7].

Under Hitler's rule, Germany quickly became a totalitarian state where many aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich,[k] meaning ""Third Realm"" or ""Third Empire"", referred to the Nazi claim that Nazi Germany was the successor to the earlier Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) and German Empire (1871–1918). The Third Reich, which the Nazis referred to as the Thousand-Year Reich,[l] ended in May 1945, after only 12 years, when the Allies defeated Germany and entered the capital, Berlin, ending World War II in Europe.. The Nazi Party became the largest in parliament following the July 1932 German federal election, but it did not hold a majority.

Action 1: Search[Sarcoidosis]
Observation 1: Sarcoidosis (also known as Besnier–Boeck–Schaumann disease) is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomata.[2] The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes.[2] Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain, though any organ can be affected.[2] The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved.[2] Often, no, or only mild, symptoms are seen.[2] When it affects the lungs, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain may occur.[3] Some may have Löfgren syndrome with fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.[2]. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown.[2] Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed.[12][13] Those with affected family members are at greater risk.[4] Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy.[6] Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the blood.[6] The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.[6]. Sarcoidosis may resolve without any treatment within a few years.[2][5] However, some people may have long-term or severe disease.[5] Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen.[8] In cases where the condition causes significant health problems, steroids such as prednisone are indicated.[9] Medications such as methotrexate, chloroquine, or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids.[9] The risk of death is  1–7%.[5] The chance of the disease returning in someone who has had it previously is less than 5%.[2]. In 2015, pulmonary sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease affected 1.9 million people globally and they resulted in 122,000 deaths.[10][11] It is most common in Scandinavians, but occurs in all parts of the world.[14] In the United States, risk is greater among black  people as opposed to white people.[14] It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50.[4] It occurs more often in women than men.[4] Sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by the English doctor Jonathan Hutchinson as a non-painful skin disease.[15]. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5% of cases.[17] Common symptoms, which tend to be vague, include fatigue (unrelieved by sleep; occurs in up to 85% of cases [18]), lack of energy, weight loss, joint aches and pains (which occur in about 70% of cases),[19] arthritis (14–38% of cases), dry eyes, swelling of the knees, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions.[20][21][22][23] Less commonly, people may cough up blood.[20] Sarcoidosis is also accompanied by psychological distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are also associated with fatigue.[24] The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from rashes and noduli (small bumps) to erythema nodosum, granuloma annulare, or lupus pernio.
Thought 2: The observation states that Sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by the English doctor Jonathan Hutchinson. Therefore, the claim that Sarcoidosis was not first described in 1877 is indeed refuted by the evidence."

Action 1: Search[Jesus]
Observation 1: Jesus[d] (c. 6 to 4 BC –  AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ,[e] Jesus of Nazareth, and many other names and titles, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.[10] He is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe Jesus to be the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Jewish messiah, the Christ that is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically.[f] Accounts of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels, especially the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament. Academic research has yielded uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and how closely they reflect the historical Jesus.[18][g] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was circumcised, was baptized by John the Baptist, began his own ministry,[10] and was often referred to as ""rabbi"".[21] Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers.[22][23] He was arrested in Jerusalem and tried by the Jewish authorities,[24] turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judea.[22] After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church.[25] Accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels.[26]. Christian theology includes the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return.[27] Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God.
Thought 2: The observation states that Jesus was a ""first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader"" and that he ""debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers."" This evidence supports the claim that Jesus was a preacher. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence."

The first recorded arrivals of Chinese people to Spain date from the late 16th century. Bernardino de Escalante in his Discurso de la navegación... (one of the first European books on China, published in 1577) says that among his sources of information were ""Chinese themselves, who came to Spain"" (""los mesmos naturales Chinas que an venido à España"").[4] Juan González de Mendoza in his History of the great and mighty kingdom of China, wrote that in 1585 ""three merchants of China"" arrived in Mexico ""and neuer staied till they came into Spaine and into other kingdomes further off.""[5]. A legal case was brought before the Council of the Indies involving two Chinese men in Seville, one a freeman, Esteban Cabrera, and the other a slave, Diego Indio, against Juan de Morales, Diego's owner.
Thought 2: Although the evidence does not directly state that Chinese people can only be associated with Spain through nationality, it does provide information about the historical presence of Chinese people in Spain.

Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto ""Més que un club"" (""More than a club""). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the ""Cant del Barça"", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions.

Observation 1: ""Cinderella"",[a] or ""The Little Glass Slipper"", is a folk tale with thousands of variants that is told throughout the world.[2][3] The protagonist is a young girl living in forsaken circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune, with her ascension to the throne via marriage. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between 7 BC and AD 23, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story.[2][3][4]. The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697.[5] Another version was later published as Aschenputtel by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812.. Although the story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean someone whose attributes are unrecognized, or someone unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect.

It spread to encompass much of what is now Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India,[16][17][18] at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath, near Varanasi, where inscriptions have been found dating to the era of the Kushan emperor Kanishka the Great.[note 3]. The Kushans were most probably one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation,[22][23] an Indo-European nomadic people of possible Tocharian origin,[24][25][26][27][28] who migrated from northwestern China (Xinjiang and Gansu) and settled in ancient Bactria.[23] The founder of the dynasty, Kujula Kadphises, followed Greek cultural ideas and iconography after the Greco-Bactrian tradition and was a follower of the Shaivite sect of Hinduism.[29] Two later Kushan kings, Vima Kadphises and Vasudeva II, were also patrons of Hinduism. The Kushans in general were also great patrons of Buddhism, and, starting with Emperor Kanishka, they employed elements of Zoroastrianism in their pantheon.[30] They played an important role in the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and China, ushering in a period of relative peace for 200 years, sometimes described as ""Pax Kushana"".[31]. The Kushans possibly used the Greek language initially for administrative purposes but soon began to use the Bactrian language.

Observation 1: Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone[2][3][4] (/stəˈloʊn/; born July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush. Stallone subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976–present), for which he also wrote the screenplays.[5] In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.. In 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum.

Action 1: Search[grunge]
Observation 1: Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is an alternative rock genre and subculture which emerged during the mid-1980s in the U.S. state of Washington, particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, but without punk's structure and speed.[3] The genre featured the distorted electric guitar sound used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth.
Thought 2: The observation gives information about grunge, but it doesn't mention anything about its commercial success or its association with Alice in Chains. So, I need to search for Alice in Chains to find the connection.
Action 2: Search[Alice in Chains]
Observation 2: Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced by Mike Inez in 1993.[1] William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who had died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.[2][3]. Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style,[4] which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell[5] (and later Cantrell and DuVall).[6] Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band..
Thought 3: The observation mentions that Alice in Chains is often associated with grunge music, but it doesn't specifically say that grunge became commercially successful due to at least one album by Alice in Chains. So, the evidence does not completely support the claim. Action 3: Finish[done]"

Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse.[2]. The causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote..

Observation 1: Nanotechnology was defined by the National Nanotechnology Initiative as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm). At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter. The definition of nanotechnology is inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties. It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.[1][1] An earlier description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.[2]. Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,[3][4] engineering,[5] microfabrication,[6] and molecular engineering.[7] The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly,[8] from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale..

In Hellenistic civilization, the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of chance gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, Tyche (literally ""Luck""), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of Fortuna, with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers including Boethius, revived strongly in the Renaissance, and survives in some forms today.[4].

Observation 1: Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication.[4] It is used to treat anxiety (including anxiety disorders), trouble sleeping, severe agitation, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.[4] It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation and to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated.[4][8] It is also used, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use.[4] It can be given by mouth or as an injection into a muscle or vein.[4] When given by injection, onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day.[4]. Common side effects include weakness, sleepiness, low blood pressure, and a decreased effort to breathe.[4] When given intravenously, the person should be closely monitored.[4] Among those who are depressed, there may be an increased risk of suicide.[4][9] With long-term use, larger doses may be required for the same effect.[4] Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur.[4] If stopped suddenly after long-term use, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur.[4] Older people more often develop adverse effects.[10] In this age group, lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures.[11] Due to these concerns, lorazepam use is generally only recommended for up to two to four weeks.[12]. Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977.[13][14] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[15] It is available as a generic medication.[4] In 2020, it was the 65th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions.[16][17]. Lorazepam is used in the short-term management of severe anxiety. In the US, the FDA advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks.[12][18] It is fast acting, and useful in treating fast onset panic anxiety.[19].
Thought 2: Although the information mentions that Lorazepam, which is sold under the brand name Ativan, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, it does not specifically state whether it is on the list of the least effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.

Action 1: Search[Love & Friendship]
Observation 1: Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure.[1] An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.[2]. Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—""the unselfish, loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another""—and its vice representing a human moral flaw akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness, or codependency.[3] It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, oneself, or animals.[4] In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[5][6] Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.[7]. Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: familial love (storge), friendly love or platonic love (philia), romantic love (eros), self-love (philautia), guest love (xenia), and divine or unconditional love (agape). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love.

Observation 1: Reportedly haunted locations:. Supernatural refers to phenomena or entities that are beyond the laws of nature.[1] The term is derived from Medieval Latin supernaturalis, from Latin super- (above, beyond, or outside of) + natura (nature).[1] Although the corollary term ""nature"" has had multiple meanings since the ancient world, the term ""supernatural"" emerged in the Middle Ages[2] and did not exist in the ancient world.[3]. The supernatural is featured in folklore and religious contexts,[4] but can also feature as an explanation in more secular contexts, as in the cases of superstitions or belief in the paranormal.[5] The term is attributed to non-physical entities, such as angels, demons, gods, and spirits. It also includes claimed abilities embodied in or provided by such beings, including magic, telekinesis, levitation, precognition, and extrasensory perception.. Occurring as both an adjective and a noun, antecedents of the modern English compound supernatural enter the language from two sources: via Middle French (supernaturel) and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (supernaturalis).

Venom has evolved in terrestrial and marine environments and in a wide variety of animals: both predators and prey, and both vertebrates and invertebrates. Venoms kill through the action of at least four major classes of toxin, namely necrotoxins and cytotoxins, which kill cells; neurotoxins, which affect nervous systems; myotoxins, which damage muscles; and haemotoxins, which disrupt blood clotting. Venomous animals cause tens of thousands of human deaths per year.. Venoms are often complex mixtures of toxins of differing types.

Observation 2: The Government of Portugal, also referred to as the Government of the Portuguese Republic, the Portuguese Government or simply the Government, is one of the four sovereignty bodies [pt] of the Portuguese Republic, together with the President of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic and the courts. It is both the body of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the Portuguese public administration.. The term ""constitutional government"" or simply ""government"" also refers to the team of ministers and its period of management under one prime minister. This concept is similar to an ""administration"" in the parlance of a presidential republic or to a ""collective ministry"" in the parlance of some Commonwealth countries. Each government in this sense is identified by a roman number, with the present one (formed in March 2022) being the XXIII Constitutional Government of Portugal since the establishment of the current democratic regime, in 1976..
Thought 3: The observation states that the Government of Portugal is one of the four sovereignty bodies in Portugal. It mentions the president, the Assembly of the Republic, and the courts as the other three bodies. It also mentions that the government conducts the general politics of the country and is the superior body of the Portuguese public administration.

In modern psychiatry the wendigo lends its name to a form of psychosis known as ""Wendigo psychosis"", which is characterized by symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and an intense fear of becoming a cannibal.[3][4] Wendigo psychosis is described as a culture-bound syndrome.

For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, expanding its size with the Prussian Army. Prussia, with its capital at Königsberg and then, when it became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany..

Action 1: Search[The Renaissance]
Observation 1: The Renaissance (UK: /rɪˈneɪsəns/ rin-AY-sənss, US: /ˈrɛnəsɑːns/ ⓘ REN-ə-sahnss)[1][a] is a period in history and a cultural movement marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity, covering the 15th and 16th centuries and characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity; it occurred after the crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change in most fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration and science. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a ""long Renaissance"" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.[3]. The traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance's early modern aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.[4][5] The beginnings of the period—the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300—overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c. 1350–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.. The Renaissance's intellectual basis was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""man is the measure of all things"". Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete.
Thought 2: There is no mention of the Renaissance being known for its rise in global temperature in the evidence. So, the claim does not have enough information to support or refute it."

Observation 1: Vedanta (/veɪˈdɑːntə/; Sanskrit: वेदान्त, IAST: Vedānta), also known as Uttara Mīmāṃsā, is one of the six orthodox (āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy. The word ""Vedanta"" means ""end of the Vedas"", and encompasses the ideas that emerged from, or were aligned with, the speculations and enumerations contained in the Upanishads, with a focus on knowledge and liberation. Vedanta developed into many schools, all of which base their ideas on the authority of a common group of texts called the Prasthānatrayī , translated as ""the three sources"": the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.[1]. All Vedanta schools contain extensive discussions on ontology, soteriology, and epistemology, even as there is much disagreement among the various schools.[2] Independently considered, they may seem completely disparate due to the pronounced differences in thoughts and reasoning.[3]. The main schools of Vedanta are: Bhedabheda or Dvaitadvaita (difference and non-difference), Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Tattvavada (Dvaita) (dualism), Suddhadvaita (pure non-dualism), and Achintya-Bheda-Abheda (inconceivable difference and non-difference).[4] Modern developments in Vedanta include Neo-Vedanta,[5][6][7] and the philosophy of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.[8].
Thought 2: The observation states that Vedanta is based on a common group of texts called the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Therefore, the claim that the Prasthanatrayi is the basic text of Vedanta is supported by the evidence provided. "

Observation 1: Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10] and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.. The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies.[11] When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.[12]. There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25.[b][13][14][15] This corresponds to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar.[16] It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox.[17] Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.[18][19][20].

Observation 1: Ramadan (Arabic: رَمَضَان, romanized: Ramaḍān [ra.ma.dˤaːn];[a] also spelled Ramazan, Ramzan, Ramadhan or Ramathan) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar,[9] observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm), prayer, reflection, and community.[10] A commemoration of Muhammad's first revelation,[11] the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam[12] and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next.[13][14]. Fasting from dawn to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, or menstruating.[15] The predawn meal is referred to as suhur, and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar.[16][17] Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca,[18] it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.[19][20][21]. The spiritual rewards (thawab) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan.[22]. Accordingly, during the hours of fasting Muslims refrain not only from food and drink, but also tobacco products, sexual relations, and sinful behavior,[23][24] devoting themselves instead to salat (prayer) and study of the Quran.[25][26]. The word Ramadan derives from the Arabic root R-M-Ḍ (ر-م-ض) ""scorching heat"",[27] which is the Classical Arabic verb ""ramiḍa (رَمِضَ)"" meaning ""become intensely hot – become burning; become scorching; be blazing; be glowing""..
Thought 2: The observation clearly states that Ramadan is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting. This supports the claim that Ramadan is observed by Muslims through fasting."

The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species (estimated to be between 250 and 500 years),[3] and is among the largest extant species of shark. It is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods.[4] As an adaptation to living at depth,[5] it has a high concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide in its tissues, which causes the meat to be toxic.[6] Greenland shark flesh, treated to reduce toxin levels, is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as kæstur hákarl.[7] As it lives in the cold depths of the Arctic and North Atlantic, isolated from human activity, it is not known to be a threat to humans, and no attacks have been recorded.. The Greenland shark is likely one of the largest living species of shark. It usually grows to between 2.4 and 7 m (7.9 and 23.0 ft) long and weighs between 400 and 1,400 kg (880 and 3,090 lb).[8][9][10][11].

Action 2: Search[Settlement of Iceland]
Observation 2: The settlement of Iceland (Icelandic: landnámsöld [ˈlantˌnaumsˌœlt]) is generally believed to have begun in the second half of the ninth century, when Norse settlers migrated across the North Atlantic. The reasons for the migration are uncertain: later in the Middle Ages Icelanders themselves tended to cite civil strife brought about by the ambitions of the Norwegian king Harald I of Norway, but modern historians focus on deeper factors, such as a shortage of arable land in Scandinavia. Unlike Great Britain and Ireland, Iceland was unsettled land and could be claimed without conflict with existing inhabitants.. On the basis of Íslendingabók by Ari Þorgilsson, and Landnámabók, histories dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and providing a wealth of detail about the settlement, the years 870 and 874 have traditionally been considered the first years of settlement. However, these sources are largely unreliable in the details they provide about the settlement, and recent research focuses more heavily on archaeological and genetic evidence.[1].
Thought 3: The observation confirms that Iceland was settled by Norse settlers in the second half of the ninth century. It mentions that on the basis of historical accounts and archaeological evidence, the years 870 and 874 are considered the first years of settlement. Therefore, the claim is indeed supported by the evidence."

Action 1: Search[Cirrhosis]
Observation 1: Cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease, is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis due to damage caused by liver disease.[6] Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time, scar tissue can replace normal functioning tissue, leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis.[6][7] The disease typically develops slowly over months or years.[1] Early symptoms may include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.[8] As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness, swelling in the lower legs, fluid build-up in the abdomen, jaundice, bruising easily, and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin.[8] The fluid build-up in the abdomen may develop into spontaneous infections.[1] More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines, and liver cancer.[9]. Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH – the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease),[10] heroin abuse,[11] chronic hepatitis B, and chronic hepatitis C.[8][12] Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease.[13] Liver damage has also been attributed to heroin usage over an extended period of time as well.[14] NASH has a number of causes, including obesity, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.[15] Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupts bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis, and chronic heart failure with liver congestion.[8]. Diagnosis is based on blood tests, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.[2][1]. Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B and the development of cirrhosis, but no vaccination against hepatitis C is available.[1] No specific treatment for cirrhosis is known, but many of the underlying causes may be treated by a number of medications that may slow or prevent worsening of the condition.[3]  Hepatitis B and C may be treatable with antiviral medications.[1] Avoiding alcohol is recommended in all cases.[1] Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with steroid medications.[1] Ursodiol may be useful if the disease is due to blockage of the bile duct.[1] Other medications may be useful for complications such as abdominal or leg swelling, hepatic encephalopathy, and dilated esophageal veins.[1] If cirrhosis leads to liver failure, a liver transplant may be an option.[15].
Thought 2: The observation says that one of the symptoms of cirrhosis is ""jaundice"", which is a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence."

Action 1: Search[French Revolution]
Observation 1: The French Revolution[a] was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse.[2]. The causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote..
Thought 2: The observation states that the French Revolution began with the Estates General in 1789 and ended in November 1799. Since the Estates General convened before 1789, it can be concluded that the French Revolution happened after the American Revolutionary War, which took place from 1775 to 1783.

Thought 1: I need to search for the song Diamonds and find if it was produced by aliens.
Action 1: Search[Diamonds]
Observation 1: Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic. Another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form of carbon at room temperature and pressure, but diamond is metastable and converts to it at a negligible rate under those conditions. Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material, properties that are used in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth.. Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid, few types of impurity can contaminate it (two exceptions are boron and nitrogen).
Thought 2: The observation does not mention the song Diamonds at all. So, there is not enough information to verify the claim that it was produced by aliens."

The village and the site lie in Gharbia Governorate along the Damietta branch of the Nile, 7 kilometers (4.5 mi) northeast of Sebennytos[2] and 8 kilometers (5 mi) west of Mansoura.[3] In ancient times it was part of the nome of Sebennytos,[4] the Twelfth Lower Egyptian Nome.[5] Ancient Egyptian texts refer to the site as early as the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), but it may have been simply an offshoot of Sebennytos rather than a full-fledged town.[2]. Sources as early as the Pyramid Texts, in the Fifth Dynasty indicate that Isis was connected with the region of Sebennytos, and she and her cult may have originated there.[4] However, major temples were not dedicated to her until the Thirtieth Dynasty, when her temples at Philae and at Behbeit El Hagar began construction.[6] The two temples paralleled each other, with Philae serving as Isis's main cult center in Upper Egypt and Behbeit El Hagar as its Lower Egyptian counterpart.[3]. The Iseion was begun in the reign of Nectanebo II (360–342 BC) and completed in the reign of Ptolemy III (r.

Observation 1: Tardigrades (/ˈtɑːrdɪˌɡreɪdz/),[1] known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets,[2][3][4][5] are a phylum of eight-legged segmented micro-animals.[2][6] They were first described by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773, who called them Kleiner Wasserbär (""little water bear"").[7] In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani named them Tardigrada (/tɑːrˈdɪɡrədə/), which means ""slow steppers"".[8]. They have been found in diverse regions of Earth's biosphere – mountaintops, the deep sea, tropical rainforests, and the Antarctic.[8] Tardigrades are among the most resilient animals known,[9][10] with individual species able to survive extreme conditions – such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and starvation – that would quickly kill most other known forms of life.[11] Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer space.[12][13] There are about 1,300 known species[14] in the phylum Tardigrada, a part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa consisting of animals that grow by ecdysis such as arthropods and nematodes. The earliest known true members of the group are known from Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) amber, found in North America, but are essentially modern forms, and therefore likely have a significantly earlier origin, as they diverged from their closest relatives in the Cambrian, over 500 million years ago.. Tardigrades are usually about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long when fully grown.[2] They are short and plump, with four pairs of legs, each ending in claws (usually four to eight) or suction disks.[2][15] Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells, algae, and small invertebrates. When collected, they may be viewed under a low-power microscope, making them accessible to students and amateur scientists.[16].
Thought 2: The observation states that Tardigrades are a phylum of eight-legged segmented micro-animals. Since they are described as segmented, it refutes the claim that Tardigrades are non-segmented animals. Therefore, the claim is refuted by the evidence."

Known as a magical order, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development. Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as Wicca[1] and Thelema, were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism.[a][b]. The three founders, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell Mathers, were Freemasons and members of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn..

Throughout antiquity and the Middle ages, the Telangana region was part of multiple Indian empires; such as the Mauryans, Satavahanas, Vishnukundinas, Chalukyas, Cholas, Rashtrakutas, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate and Golconda Sultanate. During the 17th—19th centuries, the region was ruled by the Mughals and Nizam of Hyderabad.[13][14] In 1823, the Nizam's ceded Northern Circars—(Coastal Andhra) and Ceded Districts—(Rayalseema) to the British India under subsidiary alliance which reduced it to that of a landlocked princely state bounded on all sides by the British India. Following the  Indian Independence in 1947—the Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after a police action. In 1956, the Hyderabad State was  dissolved—and its Telugu speaking region Telangana was merged with the Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.

Observation 1: Destiny, sometimes also called fate (from Latin  fatum 'decree, prediction, destiny, fate'), is a predetermined course of events.[1][2] It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.. Although often used interchangeably, the words fate and destiny have distinct connotations.. Distinguished from fate and destiny, fortune can refer to chance, or luck, as in fortunate, or to an event or set of events positively or negatively affecting someone or a group, or in an idiom, to tell someone's fortune, or simply the end result of chance and events. In Hellenistic civilization, the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of chance gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, Tyche (literally ""Luck""), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of Fortuna, with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers including Boethius, revived strongly in the Renaissance, and survives in some forms today.[4].

He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[7]. Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. However, these were not martial arts films. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights).

Administratively, the City of London is not one of the London boroughs, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including Greater London's only other city, the City of Westminster). It is also a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by Greater London, and is the smallest ceremonial county in England.. The City of London is known colloquially as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi (716.80 acres; 2.90 km2)[5] in area. Both the terms the City and the Square Mile are often used as metonyms for the UK's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City.[6] The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City.

Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, South Africa,[6] Spain, India, and Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group ""freedom fighters""[7] and digital Robin Hoods,[8] while critics have described them as ""a cyber lynch-mob""[9] or ""cyber terrorists"".[10] In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the ""100 most influential people"" in the world.[11] Anonymous' media profile diminished by 2018,[12][13] but the group re-emerged in 2020 to support the George Floyd protests and other causes.[14][15].

Inhabited by Kalinago people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other Amerindians, Spanish navigators took possession of Barbados in the late 15th century, claiming it for the Crown of Castile. It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511.[7] The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited.
Thought 2: The observation states that Barbados is an island country in the West Indies, which is located in the Caribbean region of North America. It does not mention anything about being part of the Pacific. So, the evidence is not sufficient to support or refute the claim."

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at age 13.

Observation 1: Human rights in Singapore are codified in the Constitution of Singapore, which sets out the legal rights of its citizens. These rights are protected by the Constitution and include amendments and referendums. These rights have evolved significantly from the days since independence, though the government in Singapore has broad powers to possibly limit citizens' rights or to inhibit political opposition.[1][2] In 2018, Singapore was ranked 151st by Reporters Without Borders in the Worldwide Press Freedom Index.[3] U.S.-based Freedom in the World scored Singapore 4 out of 7 for ""political rights"", and 4 out of 7 for ""civil liberties"" (where 1 is the ""most free""), with an overall ranking of ""partly free"" for the year 2015.[4]. Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, specifically Article 14(1), guarantees to Singapore citizens the rights to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly without arms, and association. However, the enjoyment of these rights may be restricted by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14(2) of the Constitution..
Thought 2: The observation states that Singapore was ranked 151st by Reporters Without Borders in the Worldwide Press Freedom Index and has laws that can restrict the enjoyment of rights to freedom of speech and expression.

Unlike most of Monroe's films, Bus Stop is neither a full-fledged comedy nor a musical, but rather a dramatic piece; it was the first film she appeared in after studying at the Actors Studio in New York. Monroe does, however, sing one song: ""That Old Black Magic"" by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer.. Bus Stop was based on the 1955 play of the same title (which in turn was expanded from an earlier, one act play People in the Wind) by William Inge.[3] The inspiration for the play came from people Inge met in Tonganoxie, Kansas.[4]. A naive, unintelligent, socially inept, loud-mouth cowboy, Beauregard Decker, and his friend and father-figure Virgil Blessing take the bus from Timber Hill, Montana to Phoenix, Arizona, to participate in a rodeo.
Thought 2: The observation states that Bus Stop (1956 film) is ""neither a full-fledged comedy nor a musical, but rather a dramatic piece"".

Observation 1: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a vector-borne disease caused by Borrelia bacteria, which are spread by ticks in the genus Ixodes.[3][8][9] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards.[1] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful.[1] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash.[1] Early diagnosis can be difficult.[10] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness.[1] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations.[1] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur.[1] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop.[1] Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of those affected develop joint pains, memory problems, and tiredness for at least six months.[1][11]. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes.[12] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. ""In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.""[13][14] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly.[14][15] In North America, the bacterial species  Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease.[3][16] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, B.
Thought 2: The observation states that ""Lyme disease is known as Lyme borreliosis which is caused by Borrelia bacteria, which are spread by ticks in the genus Ixodes. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterward."" This evidence supports the claim that Lyme disease causes erythema migrans, an expanding area of redness on the skin.

It was one of the longest-lived colonial empires in European history, lasting almost six centuries from the conquest of Ceuta in North Africa, in 1415, to the transfer of sovereignty over Macau to China in 1999. The empire began in the 15th century, and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe, with bases in Africa, North America, and South America, and various regions of Asia and Oceania.[3][4][5]. The Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery, and the power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe. In the wake of the Reconquista, Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418–1419, using recent developments in navigation, cartography, and maritime technology such as the caravel, with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice trade.
Thought 2: The observation says that the Portuguese Empire was one of the longest-lived colonial empires in European history and that it stretched across the globe, with bases in Africa, North America, South America, and various regions of Asia and Oceania.

In some versions of the myth, he is also credited with the creation of humanity from clay.[3] Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being a champion of mankind,[4] and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts and sciences.[5] He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion, the hero of the flood story.[6][7][8]. The punishment of Prometheus for stealing fire from Olympus and giving it to humans is a subject of both ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, condemned Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle—the emblem of Zeus—was sent to eat his liver (in ancient Greece, the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions).

Action 1: Search[Love & Friendship]
Observation 1: Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure.[1] An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.[2]. Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—""the unselfish, loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another""—and its vice representing a human moral flaw akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness, or codependency.[3] It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, oneself, or animals.[4] In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[5][6] Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.[7]. Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: familial love (storge), friendly love or platonic love (philia), romantic love (eros), self-love (philautia), guest love (xenia), and divine or unconditional love (agape). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love.

Action 1: Search[Hypothyroidism]
Observation 1: Hypothyroidism (also called underactive thyroid, low thyroid or hypothyreosis) is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.[3] It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, slow heart rate,  depression, and weight gain.[3] Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre.[3] Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.[5]. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.[8][9] Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine.[3] Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery.[3][10] The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.[3]. Salt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations.[7] Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism.[3] Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels.[3] Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy.[3] Although an adequate amount of dietary iodine is important, too much may worsen specific forms of hypothyroidism.[3]. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism.[11] In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3–0.4% of people.[8] Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.3–8.5% of people in the United States.[8] Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men.[3] People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected.[3] Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism, as are cats and horses, albeit more rarely.[12] The word hypothyroidism is from  Greek hypo- 'reduced',  thyreos 'shield', and eidos 'form'.[13].

Action 1: Search[tardigrades]
Observation 1: Tardigrades (/ˈtɑːrdɪˌɡreɪdz/),[1] known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets,[2][3][4][5] are a phylum of eight-legged segmented micro-animals.[2][6] They were first described by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773, who called them Kleiner Wasserbär (""little water bear"").[7] In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani named them Tardigrada (/tɑːrˈdɪɡrədə/), which means ""slow steppers"".[8]. They have been found in diverse regions of Earth's biosphere – mountaintops, the deep sea, tropical rainforests, and the Antarctic.[8] Tardigrades are among the most resilient animals known,[9][10] with individual species able to survive extreme conditions – such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and starvation – that would quickly kill most other known forms of life.[11] Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer space.[12][13] There are about 1,300 known species[14] in the phylum Tardigrada, a part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa consisting of animals that grow by ecdysis such as arthropods and nematodes. The earliest known true members of the group are known from Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) amber, found in North America, but are essentially modern forms, and therefore likely have a significantly earlier origin, as they diverged from their closest relatives in the Cambrian, over 500 million years ago.. Tardigrades are usually about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long when fully grown.[2] They are short and plump, with four pairs of legs, each ending in claws (usually four to eight) or suction disks.[2][15] Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells, algae, and small invertebrates. When collected, they may be viewed under a low-power microscope, making them accessible to students and amateur scientists.[16].
Thought 2: The evidence clearly states that tardigrades have been found in diverse regions of Earth's biosphere, including mountaintops, the deep sea, tropical rainforests, and the Antarctic. It mentions nothing about them being found only in deserts. Therefore, the claim is refuted by the evidence provided."

Observation 1: A central venous catheter (CVC), also known as a  central line (c-line), central venous line, or central venous access catheter, is a catheter placed into a large vein. It is a form of venous access. Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclavian vein or axillary vein), groin (femoral vein), or through veins in the arms (also known as a PICC line, or peripherally inserted central catheters).. Central lines are used to administer medication or fluids that are unable to be taken by mouth or would harm a smaller peripheral vein, obtain blood tests (specifically the ""central venous oxygen saturation""), administer fluid or blood products for large volume resuscitation, and measure central venous pressure.[1][2] The catheters used are commonly 15–30 cm in length, made of silicone or polyurethane, and have single or multiple lumens for infusion.[3].

Anatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out for the Near East and elsewhere in the Middle Paleolithic period.[20][21][22][23][24] Southwestern Ethiopia has been proposed as a possible homeland of the Afroasiatic language family.[25] In 980 BC, the Kingdom of D'mt extended its realm over Eritrea and the northern region of Ethiopia, while the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region for 900 years. Christianity was embraced by the kingdom in 330,[26] and Islam arrived by the first Hijra in 615.[27] After the collapse of Aksum in 960, a variety of kingdoms, largely tribal confederations, existed in the land of Ethiopia.

Considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time,[4] Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems.[5][6] These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.[7][8]. Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi, defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, working on statics and hydrostatics. Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever,[9] the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity,[10] and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy or Archimedes' principle.[11] He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion..

Observation 1: Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs, also known as antinuclear factor or ANF)[2] are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus. In normal individuals, the immune system produces antibodies to foreign proteins (antigens) but not to human proteins (autoantigens). In some cases, antibodies to human antigens are produced.[3]. There are many subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro antibodies, anti-La antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-nRNP antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, antibodies to nuclear pore complexes,  anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies. Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus.
Thought 2: From the observation, it states that there are many subtypes of ANAs, including anti-nRNP antibodies. This supports the claim that anti-nRNP antibodies are a subtype of anti-nuclear antibodies. So, the evidence indeed supports the claim."

Observation 1: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released as the lead single from their fourth album, A Night at the Opera (1975). Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, the song is a six-minute suite,[4] notable for its lack of a refraining chorus and consisting of several sections: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda.[5] It is one of the few progressive rock songs of the 1970s to achieve widespread commercial success and appeal to a mainstream audience.[6]. Mercury referred to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as a ""mock opera"" that resulted from the combination of three songs he had written. It was recorded by Queen and co-producer Roy Thomas Baker at five studios between August and September 1975. Due to recording logistics of the era, the band had to bounce the tracks across eight generations of 24-track tape, meaning that they required nearly 200 tracks for overdubs.

It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.. Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and of making political commentary.

For playing Antonius Proximo, the old, gruff gladiator trainer in Ridley Scott's Gladiator, in what was his final film, Reed was posthumously nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 2000. At the peak of his career, in 1971, British exhibitors voted Reed fifth-most-popular star at the box office.[1] The British Film Institute (BFI) stated that ""partnerships with Michael Winner and Ken Russell in the mid-[19]60s saw Reed become an emblematic Brit-flick icon"", but from the mid-1970s his alcoholism began affecting his career, with the BFI adding: ""Reed had assumed Robert Newton's mantle as Britain's thirstiest thespian"".[2]. Robert Oliver Reed was born on 13 February 1938 at 9 Durrington Park Road,[3] Wimbledon, southwest London, to Peter Reed, a sports journalist, and Marcia (née Napier-Andrews).[4] He was the nephew of film director Sir Carol Reed, and grandson of the actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his mistress, Beatrice May Pinney (who later assumed the name 'Reed'),[5] she being ""the only person who understood, listened to, encouraged and kissed Oliver"".[6] Reed claimed to have been a descendant (through an illegitimate step) of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia.[7] Reed attended 14 schools,[8] including Ewell Castle School in Surrey.

His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic.[4] It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.[5] His best known works include the novella The Metamorphosis and novels The Trial and The Castle. The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his writing.[6]. Kafka was born into a middle-class German-speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today the capital of the Czech Republic).[7] He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time by an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time.

Observation 1: The Connaught Tunnel is in southeastern British Columbia, on the Revelstoke–Donald segment. The 5.022-mile (8.082 km) tunnel carries the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) main line under Mount Macdonald in the Selkirk Mountains, replacing the previous routing over Rogers Pass.. Traffic restrictions imposed by a single track comprising 46 miles (74 km) of 2.2 percent gradients,[1] emerging competition,[2] and snow-related costs,[3] were negative factors. The 1910 Rogers Pass avalanche, and other avalanches on the pass, influenced, but did not unduly pressure CP to consider alternatives.[4] However, snow clearing and maintaining snow sheds was an ongoing burden.[5]. Rarely assigning more than one pusher locomotive per train, trains over 1,016 tons had to be cut.[6] Higher capacity locomotives had helped,[7] but the next leap forward would not occur until the Selkirk locomotives emerged in 1929.[8] In 1912, the average eight trains (peaking at 11) per day in each direction, were forecast to double over the next four years.

Observation 1: Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs, also known as antinuclear factor or ANF)[2] are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus. In normal individuals, the immune system produces antibodies to foreign proteins (antigens) but not to human proteins (autoantigens). In some cases, antibodies to human antigens are produced.[3]. There are many subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro antibodies, anti-La antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-nRNP antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, antibodies to nuclear pore complexes,  anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies. Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus.
