Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001 : A Space Odyssey , published soon after the film was released . The film follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer Hal after the discovery of a mysterious black monolith affecting human evolution . It deals with the themes of existentialism , human evolution , technology , artificial intelligence , and extraterrestrial life . It is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight , pioneering special effects , and ambiguous imagery . It uses sound and minimal dialogue in place of traditional narrative techniques ; the soundtrack consists of classical music such as Gayane Ballet Suite , The Blue Danube , Also sprach Zarathustra , and pieces from contemporary composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti .   2001 : A Space Odyssey was financed and distributed by American studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , but it was filmed and edited almost entirely in England using the studio facilities of the MGM-British Studios and those of Shepperton Studios , mostly because of the availability of much larger sound stages than in the United States . Production was subcontracted to Kubrick 's production company , and care was taken that the film would be sufficiently British to qualify for subsidy from the Eady Levy . Kubrick had shot his previous two films in England and decided to settle there permanently during filming .   2001 : A Space Odyssey initially received mixed reactions from critics and audiences , but it garnered a cult following and slowly became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968 . It was nominated for four Academy Awards and received one for its visual effects . The sequel 2010 was released in 1984 , directed by Peter Hyams .   Today , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made . In 1991 , it was deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry . The critics ' polls in the 2002 and 2012 editions of Sight & Sound magazine ranked 2001 : A Space Odyssey sixth in the top ten films of all time ; it also tied for second place in the directors ' poll of the same magazine . In 2010 , it was named the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

R. Martin . He began the first volume of the series , A Game of Thrones , in 1991 and had it published in 1996 . Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011 , A Dance with Dragons , took Martin five years to write . He is still writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter .   A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine , in the first novel , to thirty-one by the fifth . Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne .   Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .   As of April 2015 , the books have sold more than 60 million copies worldwide and , as of January 2017 , have been translated into 47 languages . The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller lists upon their releases .

6. The claim appears to be made up or based on personal opinion rather than factual knowledge or expertise.
7. The numbered list provided does not correspond to the assumption made in the claim.
8. There may be other assumptions that were not considered in the list or the claim as a whole.","In basketball , a block or blocked shot occurs when a defensive player legally deflects a field goal attempt from an offensive player . The defender is not allowed to make contact with the offensive player 's hand -LRB- unless the defender is also in contact with the ball -RRB- or a foul is called . In order to be legal , the block must occur while the shot is traveling upward or at its apex . A deflected field goal that is made does not count as a blocked shot and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team . Every successful blocked shot is counted as a missed field goal attempt for the shooter . Also , on a shooting foul , a blocked shot can not be awarded or counted , even if the player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who committed the foul . If the ball is heading downward when the defender hits it , it is ruled as goaltending and counts as a made basket . Goaltending is also called if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard -LRB- NFHS excepted ; the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009 -- 10 season -RRB- .   Nicknames for blocked shots include `` rejections , '' `` stuffs , '' `` bushed '' , `` fudged '' , or notably `` double-fudged '' -LRB- two-handed blocks -RRB- , `` facials , '' `` swats , '' `` denials , '' and `` packs . '' Blocked shots were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973 -- 74 season .   Largely due to their height and position near the basket , centers and power forwards tend to record the most blocks , but shorter players with good jumping ability can also be blockers , an example being Dwyane Wade , the shortest player , at 6 ' 4 '' , to record 100 blocked shots in a single season . A player with the ability to block shots can be a positive asset to a team 's defense , as they can make it difficult for opposing players to shoot near the basket and by keeping the basketball in play , as opposed to swatting it out of bounds , a blocked shot can lead to a fast break , a skill Bill Russell was notable for . To be a good shot-blocker , a player needs great court sense and timing , and good height or jumping ability . One tactic is that a shot-blocker can intimidate opponents to alter their shots , resulting in a miss . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

There are many subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro antibodies , anti-La antibodies , anti-Sm antibodies , anti-nRNP antibodies , anti-Scl-70 antibodies , anti-dsDNA antibodies , anti-histone antibodies , antibodies to nuclear pore complexes , anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies . Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus . They are found in many disorders including autoimmunity , cancer and infection , with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition . This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders , including systemic lupus erythematosus , Sj√∂gren 's syndrome , scleroderma , mixed connective tissue disease , polymyositis , dermatomyositis , autoimmune hepatitis and drug induced lupus .   The ANA test detects the autoantibodies present in an individual 's blood serum . The common tests used for detecting and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay -LRB- ELISA -RRB- . In immunofluorescence , the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre . This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable . Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant . Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20 % of the healthy population , especially the elderly . Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders , they are also found in 5 % of healthy individuals . Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease . A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

A loss of supply only has nothing to do with prime ministers.,"
1. The claim assumes that the prime minister has no direct responsibility for managing the economy and its various factors such as the supply chain and the price of fuel.
2. The claim assumes that fuel prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as global market prices, the strength of the pound, taxes, and supply chain disruptions.
3. The claim assumes that supply chain disruptions can be caused by a range of factors such as global shipping issues, labour shortages, and natural disasters.
4. The claim assumes that the government does not have complete control over global market prices or natural disasters.
5. The claim assumes that the government can influence the supply chain by investing in infrastructure, incentivising industry, and supporting research and development.
6. The claim assumes that the government has no direct responsibility for fuel prices, but may have indirect influence through taxation or subsidies.
7. The claim assumes that the current government may be taking steps to address the underlying causes of fuel shortages, but may not have done enough or implemented policies in a timely manner.
8. The claim assumes that the prime minister has some influence over how the government responds to these issues, but may not have ultimate control over the economy or fuel prices.","Loss of supply occurs where a government in a parliamentary democracy using the Westminster System or a system derived from it is denied a supply of treasury or exchequer funds , by whichever house or houses of parliament or head of state is constitutionally entitled to grant and deny supply . A defeat on a budgetary vote is one such way by which supply can be denied . Loss of supply is typically interpreted as indicating a loss of confidence in the government . Not all `` money bills '' are necessarily supply bills . For instance , in Australia , supply bills are defined as `` bills which are required by the Government to carry on its day-to-day business '' .   When a loss of supply occurs , a prime minister is generally required either by constitutional convention or by explicit constitutional instruction to either resign immediately or seek a parliamentary dissolution .   Some constitutions , however , do not allow the option of parliamentary dissolution but rather require the government to be dissolved or to resign .   A similar deadlock can occur within a presidential system , where it is also known as a budget crisis . In contrast to parliamentary systems , the failure of the legislature to authorize spending may not in all circumstances result in an election , because some such legislatures enjoy fixed terms and so can not be dissolved before a date of termination , which can result in a prolonged crisis .   A deadlock between a head of state and the legislative body can give rise and cause for a head of state to prematurely dismiss the elected government , requiring it to seek re-election . If a government maintains the support of a majority of legislators or the elected parliamentary representatives , the blocking of supply by a head of state would be seen as an abuse of authority and power . Many western countries have removed or restricted the right of a head of state to block supply or veto a government budget unless there is overwhelming justification and cause for such action .

    </ol>","Abraham Lincoln -LRB- -LSB- Ààe…™br…ôh√¶m_ÀàlI≈ãk…ôn -RSB- February 12 , 1809 -- April 15 , 1865 -RRB- was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 . Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War -- its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . In doing so , he preserved the Union , paved the way to the abolition of slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .   Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana . Largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives , in which he served for eight years . Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads . Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican -- American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice . Reentering politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois . In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas .   In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . Lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House -- no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession . Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war Democrats -LRB- called Copperheads -RRB- , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination . Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory . His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .   Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war . His primary goal was to reunite the nation . He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant . He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system . Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded . As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .   An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer .   Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival .   Upon release , Absolute Beginners received immense coverage in the British media . At the time , the British film industry was perceived as being on the point of collapse -LRB- with the recent failure of the film Revolution -RRB- . However , the film was panned by critics and became a box office bomb .

Although the film was not a success , Bowie 's theme song was very popular in the UK and reached number two in the charts .   The commercial failure of Absolute Beginners and another film released about the same time , The Mission , led to the collapse of Goldcrest , a major British film studio . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

        <li>The person producing the claim assumes that Adderall is an effective treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions.</li>
    </ol>","Adderall is a combination drug containing salts of the two enantiomers of amphetamine , a central nervous system -LRB- CNS -RRB- stimulant of the phenethylamine class . Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- and narcolepsy . It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . By salt content , the active ingredients of Adderall are 25 % levoamphetamine salts -LRB- the levorotary or ` left-handed ' enantiomer -RRB- and 75 % dextroamphetamine salts -LRB- the dextrorotary or ` right-handed ' enantiomer -RRB- .   Adderall is generally well-tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy . At therapeutic doses , Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . At these doses , it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time , fatigue resistance , and increased muscle strength . In contrast , much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control , cause rapid muscle breakdown , or induce a psychosis -LRB- e.g. , delusions and paranoia -RRB- . The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals , but most commonly include insomnia , dry mouth , and loss of appetite . The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses , such as those used for treating ADHD ; however , the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses . Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses , and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects .   The two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall -LRB- i.e. , levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine -RRB- alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain , which results from their interactions with trace amine associated receptor 1 -LRB- TAAR1 -RRB- and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 -LRB- VMAT2 -RRB- in neurons . Dextroamphetamine is a more potent stimulant than levoamphetamine , but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life -LRB- i.e. , it remains in the body longer -RRB- than dextroamphetamine . The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone . Adderall 's active ingredient , amphetamine , shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines , particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a positional isomer of amphetamine .

Adolf Hitler encouraged settler colonialism.,"[Assumption 1] Adolf Hitler was a leader who advocated for the expansion of the German nation. [Assumption 2] This expansion included the annexation of other countries and the creation of German settlements within their territories. [Assumption 3] Hitler's expansionist policies were based on the idea that the German people were superior to those of other nations and therefore had a right to conquer and rule them. [Assumption 4] Hitler saw settler colonialism as a way to increase Germany's power and territory, and he encouraged it as a means of expanding Germany's influence. [Assumption 5] Hitler's policies led to the creation of German settlements in countries like Poland and Ukraine, which were intended to be permanent. [Assumption 6] Hitler saw settler colonialism as a way to create a more homogenous population and to eradicate the existing inhabitants. [Assumption 7] Hitler's policies led to the displacement and extermination of millions of people, including Jews, Slavs, and Romas. [Assumption 8] Hitler's ideas influenced later settler colonialism movements around the world.</s> 
How do historians evaluate claims made about complex historical figures and events like Adolf Hitler's settler colonialism policies, especially when they involve controversial topics that require nuanced understandings of history and society?</s> 
Historians use a variety of methods to evaluate claims about complex historical figures and events like Adolf Hitler's settler colonialism policies:

1. Primary Sources: Historians examine the primary sources that document Hitler's actions and policies, such as his speeches, writings, and orders to his military. This can include documents from Nazi archives and other archives around the world.

2. Contextualization: Historians examine Hitler's actions and policies within the historical and social context of Germany and Europe at the time. This includes understanding Nazi ideology, the Second World War, and the Holocaust.

3. Analysis: Historians analyze the actions and policies of Hitler and the Nazi regime, looking at their impact on German society, European politics, and global power dynamics. They assess the evidence and arguments made by historians and others about Hitler's policies and their legacy.

4. Critique: Historians are expected to critically evaluate the claims made by others, including their sources and evidence. This requires an understanding of historiography, the ways in which historical scholarship has developed and changed over time.

5. Interpretation: Historians seek to interpret and explain Hitler's settler colonialism policies within a broader framework of German politics, military strategy, and ideology. They may offer their own interpretations and arguments, which are subject to peer review and critique.

Overall, historians seek to make informed and evidence-based claims about Hitler and his settler colonialism policies, while also recognizing the complex nature of history and the difficulty of interpreting events and motivations from the past. They are expected to engage in ongoing debates and discussions with other historians and the public, in order to promote a more nuanced understanding of history.","The German concept of Lebensraum -LRB- -LSB- ÀàleÀêb…ônsÀå Åa äm -RSB- , `` living space '' -RRB- refers to policies and practices of settler colonialism which proliferated in Germany from the 1890s to the 1940s .

2. Al Capone was charged with tax evasion in 1931.
3. The claim is made without consideration of any appeals or pardons that may have altered the outcome of the legal proceedings.
4. The claim is made without consideration of any additional charges or convictions for crimes unrelated to tax evasion.

6. The claim assumes that the legal proceedings were not influenced by factors such as corruption or political pressure.
7. The claim assumes that the legal system was fair and impartial.
8. The claim assumes that the statement 'prosecuted' is not subject to multiple interpretations or definitions.","Alphonse Gabriel Capone -LRB- -LSB- √¶l_k…ôÀàpo än -RSB- January 17 , 1899 -- January 25 , 1947 -RRB- , sometimes known by the nickname Scarface , was an American gangster who attained fame during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit . His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old .   Capone was born in Brooklyn in New York City to Italian immigrants . He was considered a Five Points Gang member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels . In his early twenties , he moved to Chicago and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio , head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol -- the forerunner of the Outfit -- and that was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana . A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in Capone 's rise and fall . Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him , handing control to Capone . Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means , but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city 's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement .   Capone apparently reveled in attention , such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games . He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a `` modern-day Robin Hood '' . However , the Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre of gang rivals , resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight , damaged Chicago 's image -- as well as Capone 's -- leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him `` Public Enemy No. 1 '' .   The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone , and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931 , a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era . During the highly publicized case , the judge admitted as evidence Capone 's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior -LRB- and ultimately abortive -RRB- negotiations to pay the government any back taxes he owed . Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison . After conviction , he replaced his old defense team with experts in tax law , and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a Supreme Court ruling , but his appeal ultimately failed .   He was already showing signs of syphilitic dementia early in his sentence , and he became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years . On January 25 , 1947 , Capone died of cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

Rodriguez was one of the sport 's most highly touted prospects and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time .

The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft , and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18 . In 1996 , he became the Mariners ' starting shortstop and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award . Rodriguez 's combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers .

Prior to the 2004 season , Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees , for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop Derek Jeter . In his first four seasons with New York , he was twice more named AL MVP . After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season , Rodriguez signed a new 10-year , $ 275 million deal with the Yankees , extending his record for the sport 's most lucrative contract . He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs , reaching the milestone in 2007 . He won his first World Series in 2009 , which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium . The following year , he became the career leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent .

Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is true based on these assumptions.","Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions .

    As an AI language model, I cannot have an opinion, but yes, there are alternative definitions of 'person' in different contexts. Some examples are philosophical, legal, and social definitions. However, the claim above refers to Alfred Hitchcock as a human being who has an individual identity.","Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock -LRB- 13 August 1899 -- 29 April 1980 -RRB- was an English film director and producer , at times referred to as `` The Master of Suspense '' . He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres . He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England 's best director . Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939 , and became a U.S. citizen in 1955 .   Hitchcock became a highly visible public figure through interviews , movie trailers , cameo appearances in his own films , and the ten years in which he hosted the television programme Alfred Hitchcock Presents -LRB- 1955 -- 1965 -RRB- . He also fashioned for himself a recognisable directorial style . Hitchcock 's stylistic trademarks include the use of camera movement that mimics a person 's gaze , forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism . In addition , he framed shots to maximise anxiety , fear , or empathy , and used innovative forms of film editing . His work often features fugitives on the run alongside `` icy blonde '' female characters . In 1978 , film critic John Russell Taylor described Hitchcock as `` the most universally recognizable person in the world '' , and `` a straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius '' .   Prior to 1980 , there had long been talk of Hitchcock being knighted for his contribution to film . Critic Roger Ebert wrote : `` Other British directors like Sir Carol Reed and Sir Charlie Chaplin were knighted years ago , while Hitchcock , universally considered by film students to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time , was passed over '' . Hitchcock later received his knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in the 1980 New Year Honours .   Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades and is often regarded as one of the most influential directors in cinematic history . Following a 2007 critics ' poll by Britain 's Daily Telegraph in which he was ranked Britain 's greatest filmmaker , one scholar wrote : `` Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema , which would be utterly different without him . His flair was for narrative , cruelly withholding crucial information -LRB- from his characters and from the audience -RRB- and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else . '' Hitchcock 's first thriller , The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog -LRB- 1926 -RRB- , helped shape the thriller genre in film . His 1929 film , Blackmail , is often cited as the first British sound feature film , while Rear Window -LRB- 1954 -RRB- , Vertigo -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , North by Northwest -LRB- 1959 -RRB- , and Psycho -LRB- 1960 -RRB- are regularly ranked among the greatest films of all time .

","American Gods is a Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novel by English author Neil Gaiman . The novel is a blend of Americana , fantasy , and various strands of ancient and modern mythology , all centering on the mysterious and taciturn Shadow . Several of the themes touched upon in the book were previously glimpsed in The Sandman comic book series .   The book was published in 2001 by Headline in the United Kingdom and by William Morrow in the United States . A special tenth anniversary edition , which includes the `` author 's preferred text '' and 12,000 additional words , was published in June 2011 by William Morrow . The text is identical to the signed and numbered limited edition released in 2003 by Hill House Publishers , and to the edition from Headline , Gaiman 's publisher in the UK since 2005 . The tenth anniversary edition marks the first time the author 's preferred text has been available in wide release outside the UK . Gaiman also did an extensive sold-out book tour celebrating the tenth anniversary and promoting the book in 2011 .   There are two audio versions of the book , both produced and published by Harper Audio : an unabridged version of the original published edition , read by George Guidall , released in 2001 ; and a full cast audiobook version of the tenth anniversary edition , including the author 's preferred text and 12,000 additional words , released in 2011 . The full cast audiobook project also was announced on Neil Gaiman 's blog , along with a contest in which participants could submit audio auditions and the winner would get an all expense paid trip to New York City , to record a part for the audio book .   In March 2017 , The Folio Society published a special collector 's edition of American Gods with many corrections to the author 's preferred text version . Gaiman described it as ` the cleanest text there has ever been ' .   In April 2017 , Starz began airing an eponymous television adaptation of the novel . Bryan Fuller and Michael Green serve as showrunners , and Gaiman is an executive producer . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

It premiered on October 7 , 2015 , and concluded January 13 , 2016 . The series was renewed in October 2014 , with the subtitle Hotel being announced in February 2015 . Hotel marks the first season to not feature series mainstays Jessica Lange and Frances Conroy . Returning cast from previous seasons of the series include : Evan Peters , Sarah Paulson , Denis O'Hare , Lily Rabe , Kathy Bates , Angela Bassett , Chlo√´ Sevigny , Finn Wittrock , Wes Bentley , Gabourey Sidibe , Mare Winningham , Matt Bomer , Christine Estabrook , Matt Ross , John Carroll Lynch , and Anthony Ruivivar , along with new cast members Lady Gaga and Cheyenne Jackson . Breaking from the anthological format , like Freak Show , the season is interconnected to the first and third seasons , and features an appearance by the Murder House , its original owner Dr. Charles Montgomery -LRB- Ross -RRB- , its realtor Marcy -LRB- Estabrook -RRB- , and the psychic Billie Dean Howard -LRB- Paulson -RRB- , as well as the appearance of the witch Queenie -LRB- Sidibe -RRB- .   The plot centers around the enigmatic Hotel Cortez in Los Angeles , California , that catches the eye of an intrepid homicide detective -LRB- Bentley -RRB- . The Cortez is host to the strange and bizarre , spearheaded by its owner , The Countess -LRB- Gaga -RRB- , who is a bloodsucking fashionista . The hotel is loosely based on an actual hotel built in 1893 by H. H. Holmes in Chicago , Il . for the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition . It became known as the ` Murder Castle ' as it was built for Holmes to torture , murder , and dispose of evidence just as is the Cortez . This season features two murderous threats in the form of the Ten Commandments Killer , a serial offender who selects his victims in accordance with biblical teachings , and `` the Addiction Demon '' , who roams the hotel armed with a drill bit dildo .   According to creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy , thematically , Hotel is much darker than previous seasons . Inspiration came from old hotel horror films and actual hotels situated in downtown Los Angeles with a reputation for sinister events , including the Cecil . The cycle also marks a return to filming in Los Angeles , where the first two seasons were shot . Hotel features one of the most expansive sets in American Horror Story history , with production designer Mark Worthington building two stories on a soundstage , along with a working elevator and stairway . In July 2015 , FX launched a marketing campaign for the series , with most trailers and teasers touting Gaga 's involvement .   Although Hotel was originally reported to consist of thirteen episodes -LRB- √† la Asylum , Coven , and Freak Show -RRB- , that number was later revised to twelve -LRB- √† la Murder House -RRB- . The season garnered a total of eight Emmy Award nominations , including two acting nominations for Paulson and Bates . It was the first time , however , that a season of American Horror Story was not nominated for Outstanding Limited Series . In addition , Gaga won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress -- Mini-Series or Television Film while Hotel received a nomination for Best Mini-Series or Television Film . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Produced by Rob Cavallo , the album was released in the UK on September 20 , 2004 and in the US on September 21 , 2004 by Reprise Records . Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s with a string of successful albums . Following disappointing sales of their sixth album , Warning -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , the band took a break before recording their next album , titled Cigarettes and Valentines . The recording process was cut short when the album 's master tapes were stolen . Rather than re-record that material , the group decided to start over .   A concept album and the world 's first `` punk rock opera , '' American Idiot follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia , an adolescent anti-hero who is divided between `` rage and love . '' Through its plot , the album expresses the disillusionment and dissent of a generation that came of age in a period shaped by many tumultuous events like the Iraq War . The album was inspired by several musicals and the work of The Who . Recording of American Idiot was split between two California studios between 2003 and 2004 . Its album art depicts a heart-shaped hand grenade .   American Idiot marked a career comeback for Green Day following a period of decreased success . It charted in 27 countries , peaking at number one in 19 , and eventually sold 16 million copies worldwide . The album spawned five successful singles : `` American Idiot '' , `` Boulevard of Broken Dreams '' , `` Holiday '' , `` Wake Me Up When September Ends '' and `` Jesus of Suburbia '' . American Idiot was well received critically and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2005 . Its success inspired a Broadway musical and an incomplete feature film adaptation .

    <p>The claim is valid because it is specific and supported by historical evidence. The assumption that ancient Algeria has been inhabited continuously for many centuries is a reasonable one, given the evidence of ancient civilizations in the region.

8. The claim was not made based on personal bias or opinion, but rather objective evidence and analysis of Andy Kaufman's work and its impact on his field.","Andrew G. Kaufman -LRB- January 17 , 1949 -- May 16 , 1984 -RRB- was an American entertainer , actor , writer , performance artist and professional wrestler . While often referred to as a comedian , Kaufman described himself instead as a `` song and dance man . '' He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood , once saying in a rare introspective interview , `` I am not a comic , I have never told a joke . ... The comedian 's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him . ... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can . ''   After working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s , Kaufman first came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975 , when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of Saturday Night Live . His Foreign Man character was the basis of his role as Latka Gravas on the hit television show Taxi , on which he appeared from 1978 until 1983 . During this time , he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art / comedy shows , sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude lounge singer Tony Clifton . He was also a frequent guest on sketch comedy and late-night talk shows , particularly Late Night with David Letterman . In 1982 , Kaufman brought his professional wrestling villain act to Letterman 's show with a staged encounter with Jerry `` The King '' Lawler of the Continental Wrestling Association -LRB- although the fact that the altercation was planned in advance was not publicly disclosed for over a decade -RRB- .   Kaufman died of lung cancer at age 35 in 1984 . However , because pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career , persistent rumors have circulated insisting that Kaufman faked his own death as a grand hoax . His body of work maintains a cult following and he continues to be respected for his original material , unique performance style , and unflinching commitment to character . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S. , Israel , Tunisia , Uganda , and others ; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; child pornography sites ; copyright protection agencies ; the Westboro Baptist Church ; and corporations such as PayPal , MasterCard , Visa , and Sony .

"Audi used to have the pet ""Truth in Engineering.""","(1) Audi is a company that has existed in the past and has been known for producing cars.
    (2) In the past, Audi used the slogan ""Truth in Engineering"" to promote its cars.
    (3) The phrase ""pet"" implies that Audi has claimed ownership of the slogan and has used it in some form of advertising or marketing.
    (4) The claim does not state when Audi stopped using the slogan, so it could be assumed that they still use it or have used it in the past few years.
    (5) Audi is a German company, so the claim assumes that the company is likely to have used the slogan in German-speaking countries, as well as in English-speaking countries.
    (6) The claim also assumes that Audi is still in business and has not gone bankrupt or been acquired by another company.
    (7) The claim does not state whether Audi was the only auto manufacturer to use the slogan ""Truth in Engineering,"" so it could be assumed that other companies used it as well.
    7) The claim does not state how the claim was verified or how the information was obtained, so it could be assumed that the claim was obtained from a reliable source of information, such as the Audi website or a press release.","Audi -LRB- -LSB- Àà îa äÃØd…™  îaÀêÀàgeÀê -RSB- -RRB- is a German automobile manufacturer that designs , engineers , produces , markets and distributes luxury vehicles .

The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi 's predecessor company , Auto Union .

Augusto Pinochet died in 2006.,"(Assume nothing about the veracity of the claim.)
    1. The year 2006 was in the Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used calendar today.
    2. Augusto Pinochet was indeed dead in the year 2006.
    3. The news outlets reporting Pinochet's death were reliable sources.
    4. The date of Pinochet's death was reported accurately by the news outlets.
    5. Time travel was not a factor in Pinochet's death, as this would have likely been reported in the news.
    6. There were no other historical or political events happening at the time that could have affected public awareness of Pinochet's death.
    7. The claim was not intended as a joke or satire.
    8. Pinochet was a well-known historical figure and his death was widely reported at the time.","Augusto Jos√© Ram√≥n Pinochet Ugarte -LRB- -LSB- auÀà…£usto pinoÀà -LRB- t -RRB-  Ée -RSB- or -LSB- - Àà -LRB- t -RRB-  Éet -RSB- 25 November 1915 -- 10 December 2006 -RRB- was a Chilean general , politician and the military ruler of Chile between 1973 and 1990 ; he remained the Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 1998 . He was also president of the Government Junta of Chile between 1973 and 1981 . His rule of Chile was a dictatorship .   Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a United States-backed coup d'√©tat on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the democratically elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule . Several academics have stated that the support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterward . Pinochet had been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army by Allende on 23 August 1973 , having been its General Chief of Staff since early 1972 . In December 1974 , the ruling military junta appointed Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation by joint decree , although without the support of one of the coup 's instigators , Air Force General Gustavo Leigh .   From the start of the new military government harsh measures were implemented . During the period of Pinochet 's rule , various investigations have identified the murder of 1,200 to 3,200 people with up to 80,000 people forcibly interned and as many as 30,000 tortured . According to the Chilean government , the official number of deaths and forced disappearances stands at 3,095 .   Under the influence of the free market-oriented neoliberal `` Chicago Boys '' , the military government implemented economic liberalization , including currency stabilization , removed tariff protections for local industry , banned trade unions and privatized social security and hundreds of state-owned enterprises . These policies produced what has been referred to as the `` Miracle of Chile , '' but critics state that economic inequality dramatically increased and attribute the devastating effects of the 1982 monetary crisis on the Chilean economy to these policies . Chile was , for most of the 1990s , the best-performing economy in Latin America , though the legacy of Pinochet 's reforms continues to be in dispute .   Pinochet 's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a controversial 1980 plebiscite , which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission . In a 1988 plebiscite 56 % voted against Pinochet 's continuing as president , which led to democratic elections for the Presidency and Congress . After stepping down in 1990 , Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998 , when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution . However , Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights violations . Following a legal battle he was released on grounds of ill-health , and returned to Chile on 3 March 2000 . In 2004 , Chilean Judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest . By the time of his death on 10 December 2006 , about 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule , and tax evasion and embezzlement during and after his rule ; he was accused of having corruptly amassed at least 28 million USD . Despite the indictment and 300 charges , he only served time in house arrest . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

To answer your question about why the assumption `Avenged Sevenfold released an album` is true, it is because it was reported by the media and confirmed by the band itself. The assumption is based on the fact that the band is known for releasing albums, and the claim was supported by evidence such as a press release, a statement from the band, the presence of the album on music streaming platforms, and reviews from fans and critics.","Avenged Sevenfold -LRB- sometimes abbreviated as A7X -RRB- is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach , California , formed in 1999 . The band 's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows , rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance , lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates , bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ , and drummer Brooks Wackerman .   Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise . Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band 's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet . However , Avenged Sevenfold 's style had evolved by the band 's third album and first major label release , City of Evil , into a heavy metal and hard rock style . The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer , James `` The Rev '' Sullivan , died in 2009 . Despite his death , Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and released and toured in support of its fifth album Nightmare in 2010 , which debuted on the top spot of the Billboard 200 , Avenged Sevenfold 's first number one debut . In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording . Avenged Sevenfold 's sixth studio album Hail to the King , which was released in 2013 , marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Arin Ilejay . Hail to the King charted as number 1 on the Billboard 200 , the UK Albums chart , as well as the Finnish , Brazilian , Canadian , and Irish charts . In late 2014 Ilejay left the band , and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman , but was n't revealed as his replacement until in 2015 the band announced Ilejay 's departure . The band surprise released their seventh studio album titled The Stage on October 28 , 2016 , which debuted as number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US . The Stage is their first conceptual album and it marked another stylistic change for the band , moving towards the progressive metal sound .   To date , Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums , one live album/DVD , two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide . Avenged Sevenfold was ranked # 47 on Loudwire 's list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

He is the lead vocalist of the hard rock band Guns N ' Roses , and has also been the band 's sole constant member since its inception in 1985 . In addition to Guns N ' Roses , he is also the current lead singer of AC/DC since 2016 . Due to his powerful and wide vocal range and energetic live performances , Rose has been named one of the greatest singers of all time by various media outlets , including Rolling Stone and NME .   Born and raised in Lafayette , Indiana , Rose moved to Los Angeles in the early 1980s , where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands , including Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns . In 1985 , he co-founded Guns N ' Roses , with whom he had great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Their first album , Appetite for Destruction -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide , and is one of the best-selling debut albums of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold . Its full-length follow-ups , the twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , were also widely successful ; they respectively debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide .   After 1994 , following the conclusion of their two-and-a-half-year Use Your Illusion Tour , Rose disappeared from public life for several years , while the band disintegrated due to personal and musical differences . As its sole remaining original member , he was able to continue working under the Guns N ' Roses banner because he had legally obtained the band name . In 2001 , he resurfaced with a new line-up of Guns N ' Roses at Rock in Rio 3 , and subsequently played periodic concert tours to promote the long-delayed Chinese Democracy -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , which undersold the music industry 's commercial expectations despite positive reviews upon its release . In 2012 , Rose was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N ' Roses , though he declined to attend the event and requested exclusion from the Hall .

Educated in Russia , she moved to the United States in 1926 . She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 -- 1936 . After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , The Fountainhead .   In 1957 , Rand published her best-known work , the novel Atlas Shrugged . Afterward , she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 . Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge , and rejected faith and religion . She supported rational and ethical egoism , and rejected altruism . In politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral , and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights . In art , Rand promoted romantic realism . She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , and classical liberals .   Literary critics received Rand 's fiction with mixed reviews , and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy , though academic interest has increased in recent decades .

    - 7. Babe Ruth had a successful career with good statistics.
    8. Babe Ruth was a notable person in the history of baseball.
    
Note that the above assumptions are not necessarily true and may be disputed by different sources.","George Herman `` Babe '' Ruth Jr. -LRB- February 6 , 1895 -- August 16 , 1948 -RRB- was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed `` The Bambino '' and `` The Sultan of Swat '' , he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting -LRB- and some pitching -RRB- records , including career home runs -LRB- 714 -RRB- , runs batted in -LRB- RBIs -RRB- -LRB- 2,213 -RRB- , bases on balls -LRB- 2,062 -RRB- , slugging percentage -LRB- .6897 -RRB- , and on-base plus slugging -LRB- OPS -RRB- -LRB- 1.164 -RRB- ; the latter two still stand today . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its `` first five '' inaugural members .   At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with Boston , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 .   After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86 year championship drought and popularized the `` Curse of the Bambino '' superstition . In his 15 years with New York , Ruth helped the Yankees win seven American League -LRB- AL -RRB- championships and four World Series championships . His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport 's popularity but also helped usher in the live-ball era of baseball , in which it evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor . As part of the Yankees ' vaunted `` Murderer 's Row '' lineup of 1927 , Ruth hit 60 home runs , extending his MLB single-season record . He retired in 1935 after a short stint with the Boston Braves . During his career , Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times .   Ruth 's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure in the Roaring Twenties . During his career , he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing . His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages . After his retirement as a player , he was denied a managerial job in baseball , most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career . In his final years , Ruth made many public appearances , especially in support of American efforts in World War II . In 1946 , he became ill with cancer , and died two years later . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

7. The Indian power mentioned in the claim did not use any tactics or strategies that were not common in military conquests of the time.
8. The Indian power mentioned in the claim was not motivated by any external factors such as alliances or trade agreements.","The Maratha Empire or the Maratha Confederacy was an Indian power that existed from 1674 to 1818 and ruled over much of the Indian sub-continent . The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending the Mughal rule in India .   The Marathas are a Hindu warrior group from the western Deccan Plateau -LRB- present day Maharashtra -RRB- that rose to prominence by establishing a Hindavi Swarajya . The Marathas became prominent in the seventeenth century under the leadership of Shivaji who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughal Empire and carved out a kingdom with Raigad as his capital . Known for their mobility , the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal -- Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of India .   Chhattrapati Shahu , grandson of Shivaji , was released by Mughals after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb . Following a brief struggle with his aunt Tarabai , Shahu became ruler and appointed Balaji Vishwanath and later , his descendants , as the peshwas or prime ministers of the empire .

The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south to Peshawar -LRB- modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan -RRB- in the north , and Bengal and Andaman Islands in the east . In 1761 , the Maratha Army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan . Ten years after Panipat , the young Peshwa Madhavrao I 's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India .   In a bid to effectively manage the large empire , Madhavrao I gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights , which created a confederacy of Maratha states .

In 1775 , the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune , which became the First Anglo-Maratha War , resulting in the Maratha victory .

It is a small , densely populated country which covers an area of 30528 km2 and has a population of about 11 million people . Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe , Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups : the Dutch-speaking , mostly Flemish community , which constitutes about 59 % of the population , and the French-speaking , mostly Walloon population , which comprises 41 % of all Belgians . Additionally , there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area , and bordering Germany .   Historically , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg -LRB- along with parts of Northern France and Western Germany -RRB- were known as the Low Countries ; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states . The region was called Belgica in Latin , after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica . From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century , the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture . From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830 , when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands , the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers , causing it to be dubbed the `` Battlefield of Europe , ''  a reputation strengthened by both world wars .   Today , Belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance . It is divided into three regions and three communities , that exist next to each other . Its two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia . The Brussels-Capital Region is an officially bilingual -LRB- French and Dutch -RRB- enclave within the Flemish Region .  A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia .  Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .   Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution  and , during the course of the 20th century , possessed a number of colonies in Africa . The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia . This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms , resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993 . Despite the reforms , tensions between the groups have remained , if not increased ; there is significant separatism particularly among the Flemish ; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities ; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election , a world record . Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the European Union and hosts the official seats of the European Commission , Council of the European Union , and European Council , as well as a seat of the European Parliament in the country 's capital , Brussels . Belgium is also a founding member of the Eurozone , NATO , OECD and WTO , and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union . Its capital , Brussels , hosts several of the EU 's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO.Belgium is a member of , or affiliated to , many international organizations , including ACCT , AfDB , AsDB , Australia Group , Benelux , BIS , CCC , CE , CERN , EAPC , EBRD , EIB , EMU , ESA , EU , FAO , G-10 , IAEA , IBRD , ICAO , ICC , ICRM , IDA , IDB , IEA , IFAD , IFC , IFRCS , IHO , ILO , IMF , IMO , IMSO , Intelsat , Interpol , IOC , IOM , ISO , ITU , MONUC -LRB- observers -RRB- , NATO , NEA , NSG , OAS -LRB- observer -RRB- , OECD , OPCW , OSCE , PCA , UN , UNCTAD , UNECE , UNESCO , UNHCR , UNIDO , UNMIK , UNMOGIP , UNRWA , UNTSO , UPU , WADB -LRB- non-regional -RRB- , WEU , WHO , WIPO , WMO , WTrO , ZC .

He is the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered the largest financial fraud in U.S. history . Prosecutors estimated the size of the fraud to be $ 64.8 billion , based on the amounts in the accounts of Madoff 's 4,800 clients as of November 30 , 2008 .   Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960 , and was its chairman until his arrest on December 11 , 2008 .

Credit for the Joker 's creation is disputed ; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker 's design , while acknowledging Finger 's writing contribution . Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance , he was spared by editorial intervention , allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman .   In his comic book appearances , the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind . Introduced as a psychopath with a warped , sadistic sense of humor , the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority , before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s . As Batman 's nemesis , the Joker has been part of the superhero 's defining stories , including the murder of Jason Todd -- the second Robin and Batman 's ward -- and the paralysis of one of Batman 's allies , Barbara Gordon . The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances . The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white , turns his hair green , and his lips bright red ; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane . The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance , the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary .   The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities , instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions , and thematic weaponry , including razor-tipped playing cards , deadly joy buzzers , and acid-spraying lapel flowers . The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains such as the Penguin and Two-Face , and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League , but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker 's desire for unbridled chaos . The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist , Harley Quinn , who becomes his villainous sidekick . Although his primary obsession is Batman , the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman .   One of the most iconic characters in popular culture , the Joker has been listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created . The character 's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise , such as clothing and collectable items , inspire real-world structures -LRB- such as theme park attractions -RRB- , and be referenced in a number of media . The Joker has been adapted to serve as Batman 's adversary in live-action , animated , and video game incarnations , including the 1960s Batman television series -LRB- played by Cesar Romero -RRB- and in film by Jack Nicholson in Batman -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , and Jared Leto in Suicide Squad -LRB- 2016 -RRB- .

It was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and on television shows such as Saturday Night Live , Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve and Good Morning America . The song was treated with different remixes , including a `` Country Road '' version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo Salim-Sulaiman .

    </ol>","Buckingham Palace -LRB- -LSB- Ààb åk…™≈ã…ôm_Ààp√¶l…™s -RSB- -RRB- is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom . Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality . It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning .   Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen 's House . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 .   The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection .   The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle √âpoque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House . The palace has 775 rooms , and the garden is the largest private garden in London . The state rooms , used for official and state entertaining , are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

Holley was born in Lubbock , Texas , to a musical family during the Great Depression ; he learned to play guitar and to sing alongside his siblings . His style was influenced by gospel music , country music , and rhythm and blues acts , and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school . He made his first appearance on local television in 1952 , and the following year he formed the group `` Buddy and Bob '' with his friend Bob Montgomery . In 1955 , after opening for Elvis Presley , Holly decided to pursue a career in music . He opened for Presley three times that year ; his band 's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll . In October that year , when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets , Holly was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall , who helped him get a contract with Decca Records .   Holly 's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley . Unhappy with Bradley 's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there , Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis , New Mexico , and recorded a demo of `` That 'll Be the Day '' , among other songs . Petty became the band 's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records , which released it as a single credited to `` The Crickets '' , which became the name of Holly 's band . In September 1957 , as the band toured , `` That 'll Be the Day '' topped the US `` Best Sellers in Stores '' chart and the UK Singles Chart . Its success was followed in October by another major hit , `` Peggy Sue '' .   The album Chirping Crickets , released in November 1957 , reached number five on the UK Albums Chart . Holly made his second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1958 and soon after , toured Australia and then the UK . In early 1959 , Holly assembled a new band , consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings -LRB- bass -RRB- , famed session musician Tommy Allsup -LRB- guitar -RRB- , and Carl Bunch -LRB- drums -RRB- , and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. . After a show in Clear Lake , Iowa , Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show , in Moorhead , Minnesota . Soon after takeoff , the plane crashed , killing Holly , Ritchie Valens , The Big Bopper , and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don McLean as `` The Day the Music Died '' .   During his short career , Holly wrote , recorded , and produced his own material . He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars , bass , and drums . Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists , including The Beatles , The Rolling Stones , Eric Clapton , and Elton John . He was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , in 1986 . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of `` 100 Greatest Artists '' . ",REFUTES,"1.

It is also considered part of Central Africa . Burundi 's capital is Bujumbura . The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika .   The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation .   Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the world 's poorest . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .   Burundi 's political system is that of a presidential representative democratic republic based upon a multi-party state . The President of Burundi is the head of state and head of government . There are currently 21 registered parties in Burundi . On 13 March 1992 , Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution , which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition . Six years later , on 6 June 1998 , the constitution was changed , broadening National Assembly 's seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents . Because of the Arusha Accord , Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000 . In October 2016 , Burundi informed the UN of its intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court .   Burundi remains an overwhelmingly rural society , with just 13 % of the population living in urban areas in 2013 . The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre -LRB- 753 per sq mi -RRB- is the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa . Roughly 85 % of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin , 15 % are Tutsi , and fewer than 1 % are indigenous Twa -LRB- or Pygmies -RRB- . The official languages of Burundi are French and Kirundi , although Swahili can be found spoken along the Tanzanian border .   One of the smallest countries in Africa , Burundi has an equatorial climate . Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift , the western extension of the East African Rift . The country lies on a rolling plateau in the centre of Africa . The highest peak , Mount Heha at 8810 ft , lies to the southeast of the capital , Bujumbura . The source of the River Nile is in Bururi province , and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika , located in much of Burundi 's southwestern corner . There are two national parks , Kibira National Park to the northwest -LRB- a small region of rain forest , adjacent to Nyungwe Forest National Park in Rwanda -RRB- , Ruvubu National Park to the northeast -LRB- along the Rurubu River , also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu -RRB- . Both were established in 1982 to conserve wildlife populations . Burundi 's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture .   Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation , soil erosion and habitat loss . Deforestation of the entire country is almost completely due to overpopulation , with a mere 230 mi2 remaining and an ongoing loss of about 9 % per annum . In addition to poverty , Burundians often have to deal with corruption , weak infrastructure , poor access to health and education services , and hunger . Burundi is densely populated and has had substantial emigration as young people seek opportunities elsewhere . The World Happiness Report 2017 ranked Burundi as the world 's second least happy nation with a rank of 154 . ",REFUTES,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO

Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time , Agassi has been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game . Described by the BBC upon his retirement as `` perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport 's history '' , Agassi compiled performances that , along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude , saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game . As a result , he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s .   In singles tennis , Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist , as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments . During the Open Era , Agassi was the first male player to have won 4 Australian Open titles , a record that was later surpassed by Novak Djokovic when he won his 5th title on 2015 , and then by Roger Federer in 2017 .

Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces -LRB- hard , clay and grass -RRB- , and the last American male to win both the French Open -LRB- in 1999 -RRB- and the Australian Open -LRB- in 2003 -RRB- . He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 . Agassi reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No. 141 in 1997 , prompting many to believe that his career was over . Agassi returned to World No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years . During his 20-plus year tour career , Agassi was known by the nickname `` The Punisher '' .   After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis -LRB- vertebral displacement -RRB- and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve , Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3 , 2006 , after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker .

1. The size of the Earth's area is known and accurate.
2. The area of Nepal is measured using a standardized method.
3. The measurement of land area does not include water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans.
4. The claim only includes sovereign countries and not territories or dependent states.

With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , and as the group 's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .   The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player . The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act , and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit , `` Love Me Do '' , in late 1962 . They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market .

Signs and symptoms vary among people . Often , symptoms include poor coordination , stiff muscles , weak muscles , and tremors . There may be problems with sensation , vision , hearing , swallowing , and speaking . Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over , sit , crawl , or walk as early as other children of their age . Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning , each of which occurs in about one third of people with CP . While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life , the underlying problems do not worsen over time .   Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement , balance , and posture . Most often the problems occur during pregnancy ; however , they may also occur during childbirth , or shortly after birth . Often the cause is unknown . Risk factors include preterm birth , being a twin , certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella , exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy , a difficult delivery , and head trauma during the first few years of life , among others . About 2 % of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause . A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present . For example , those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy , those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy , and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy . Diagnosis is based on the child 's development over time . Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes .   CP is partly preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety . There is no cure for CP ; however , supportive treatments , medications , and surgery may help many individuals . This may include physical therapy , occupational therapy , and speech therapy . Medications such as diazepam , baclofen , and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles . Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves . Often external braces and other assistive technology are helpful . Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment . While alternative medicines are frequently used there is no evidence to support their use .   CP is the most common movement disorder in children . It occurs in about 2.1 per 1,000 live births . Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE . Extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by William John Little , after whom spastic diplegia was called `` Little disease '' . William Osler first named it `` cerebral palsy '' from the German `` zerebrale Kinderl√§hmung '' -LRB- cerebral child-paralysis -RRB- . A number of potential treatments are being examined , including stem cell therapy . However , more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Canada was never the location of a French colony.,"
1. Canada was settled by Europeans in the late 15th century and early 16th century, long before the first French settlements in 1604 in Acadia and Port Royal. 
2. The French colonized the New World for economic gain such as fur and resources, and their primary settlements were in what is now the United States and Canada.
3. The early French explorers did not establish a permanent colony in what is now Canada. The first attempts were focused in Acadia, Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence Valley.
4. Canada was colonized by British settlers who arrived in the 17th century and established several colonies, including Nova Scotia in 1621 and the Province of New Brunswick in 1784.
5. Quebec was the only French-speaking province in Canada until 1971, when the Government of Canada introduced a new policy called ""Official Languages of Canada.""
6. The French-speaking population of Canada has a long history of struggle to preserve their language and culture, including the 1982 Charter of the French Language which recognizes their official languages status.
7. Canada is a bilingual country with both English and French as official languages, and there is a large Francophone community spread across the country.
8. Although the French had a significant presence in Canada during the colonial period, their settlements and colonies were not as numerous or influential as those of the British.","New Brunswick -LRB- Nouveau-Brunswick Canadian French pronunciation : -LSB- nuvob Å…înzw…™k -RSB- -RRB- is one of Canada 's three Maritime provinces -LRB- together with Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia -RRB- and is the only constitutionally bilingual -LRB- English -- French -RRB- province .

Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell proliferation.,"
1. Assumption: All cancerous tumors have abnormal cell growth.
2. Assumption: There is only one cause of abnormal cell growth in cancerous tumors.
3. Assumption: Abnormal cell growth occurs in the same way in all types of cancer.
4. Assumption: Abnormal cell growth can only happen in tumors caused by cancer.
5. Assumption: All abnormal cell growth is caused by cancer.
6. Assumption: The same treatments will work for all types of cancer caused by abnormal cell growth.
7. Assumption: All treatments for cancer involve addressing abnormal cell growth.
8. Assumption: Cancer cells cannot exist in the body without undergoing abnormal cell growth.</s>  What implications do these assumptions have on the treatment and prevention of cancer?</s> 
These assumptions have a significant impact on the treatment and prevention of cancer. Since it is assumed that all cancerous tumors have abnormal cell growth, treatments that focus only on reducing the number of cancer cells may not be effective. Furthermore, since it is assumed that all treatments for cancer involve addressing abnormal cell growth, alternative treatments that focus on other aspects of cancer may be overlooked.

Implications on prevention are also significant. Since it is assumed that all abnormal cell growth is caused by cancer, preventive measures aimed solely at reducing abnormal cell growth may miss other causes of cancer. Additionally, since it is assumed that all cancer cells can only exist in the body if they undergo abnormal growth, prevention strategies that focus on stopping the proliferation of cells may not be effective.

To improve cancer treatment and prevention, a more holistic approach that takes into account the complex biology behind the disease, as well as the unique characteristics of each individual patient, is needed.","Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body . Not all tumors are cancerous ; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body . Possible signs and symptoms include a lump , abnormal bleeding , prolonged cough , unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements . While these symptoms may indicate cancer , they may have other causes . Over 100 types of cancers affect humans .   Tobacco use is the cause of about 22 % of cancer deaths . Another 10 % is due to obesity , poor diet , lack of physical activity , and excessive drinking of alcohol . Other factors include certain infections , exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants . In the developing world nearly 20 % of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and human papillomavirus -LRB- HPV -RRB- . These factors act , at least partly , by changing the genes of a cell . Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops . Approximately 5 -- 10 % of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person 's parents . Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests . It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy .   Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking , maintaining a healthy weight , not drinking too much alcohol , eating plenty of vegetables , fruits and whole grains , vaccination against certain infectious diseases , not eating too much processed and red meat , and avoiding too much sunlight exposure . Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer . The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial . Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy , and targeted therapy . Pain and symptom management are an important part of care . Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease . The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment . In children under 15 at diagnosis the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80 % . For cancer in the United States the average five-year survival rate is 66 % .   In 2015 about 90.5 million people had cancer . About 14.1 million new cases occur a year -LRB- not including skin cancer other than melanoma -RRB- . It caused about 8.8 million deaths -LRB- 15.7 % -RRB- of human deaths . The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer , prostate cancer , colorectal cancer and stomach cancer . In females , the most common types are breast cancer , colorectal cancer , lung cancer and cervical cancer . If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancers each year it would account for around 40 % of cases . In children , acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and brain tumors are most common except in Africa where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often . In 2012 , about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer . The risk of cancer increases significantly with age and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries . Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world . The financial costs of cancer were estimated at $ 1.16 trillion US dollars per year as of 2010 . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Cape Fear features a cameo from Robert Mitchum and it is directed by Martin Scorsese.,"- The definition of cameo is the use of a celebrity in a small role.
    - Robert Mitchum was a celebrity known for his work in 1960s American cinema.
    - Robert Mitchum died in 1997, so any film featuring his appearance would have had to be made after his death.
    - Martin Scorsese made Cape Fear in 1991.
    - If Robert Mitchum appeared in Cape Fear, it would have been in a small, uncredited role.
    - Scorsese may have wanted to pay tribute to his cinematic forefathers or include Mitchum as a favor to a friend.
    - If Robert Mitchum appeared in Cape Fear, it is likely that the cameo would not be listed in the production credits, making it harder to verify. 

Note: These assumptions may not necessarily be accurate and more research may be needed to confirm or refute them.","Cape Fear is a 1991 American psychological thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and a remake of the 1962 film of the same name . It stars Robert De Niro , Nick Nolte , Jessica Lange , and Juliette Lewis , and features cameos from Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum , and Martin Balsam , who all appeared in the original film . It was Peck 's final theatrical film . The film tells the story of a convicted rapist who , using mostly his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes , seeks vengeance against a former public defender whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment due to purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial .   Cape Fear marks the seventh of eight collaborations between Scorsese and De Niro , the others being Mean Streets -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , Taxi Driver -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , New York , New York -LRB- 1977 -RRB- , Raging Bull -LRB- 1980 -RRB- , The King of Comedy -LRB- 1982 -RRB- , Goodfellas -LRB- 1990 -RRB- and Casino -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .

Charles was the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the English , Irish , and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother , Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , in 1612 . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later , he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead .   After his succession , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views too Catholic . He supported high church ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall .   From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War . After his defeat in 1645 , he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament . Charles refused to accept his captors ' demands for a constitutional monarchy , and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647 . Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight , Charles forged an alliance with Scotland , but by the end of 1648 Oliver Cromwell 's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England . Charles was tried , convicted , and executed for high treason in January 1649 . The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared . The monarchy was restored to Charles 's son , Charles II , in 1660 . ",REFUTES,"1.

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is genre fiction.,"
Here is a list of assumptions made when producing the claim:

1. ""Genre fiction"" refers to works of literature or film that are characterized by conventions or tropes of a particular genre.

2. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is a work of science fiction, a genre characterized by the exploration of themes or concepts that are rooted in science or science fiction.

3. In order to qualify as genre fiction, a work must exhibit certain characteristics that are typical of the genre it belongs to. For example, science fiction stories often focus on technological advancements, alien encounters, and dystopian futures.

4. The plot of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes involves a group of intelligent apes who rise against their human oppressors in a dystopian future and establish their own civilization.

5. The theme of the film is the struggle between species and the power dynamics that result from the clash between different cultures and societies.

6. The use of special effects to create the apes and their society, as well as the focus on science and technology, are typical of science fiction films.

7. The film's themes align with the values and beliefs of the science fiction genre, which often explores the relationship between humanity and technology, and the dangers of unchecked technological advancement.

8. As a result, based on these assumptions, the claim that Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is genre fiction seems reasonable and supported by evidence.","Science fiction film -LRB- or sci-fi -RRB- is a genre that uses speculative , fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science , such as extraterrestrial lifeforms , alien worlds , extrasensory perception and time travel , along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft , robots , cyborgs , interstellar travel or other technologies . Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held .   The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon -LRB- 1902 -RRB- employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis -LRB- 1927 -RRB- - being the first feature length science fiction movie .

After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously .

De Profundis was written during an imprisonment.,"
1. Oscar Wilde was imprisoned from 1895 to 1897. 
2. De Profundis is a letter that was written during Oscar Wilde's imprisonment. 
3. De Profundis was written in the prison library, where he had access to books. 
4. De Profundis is a lengthy and complex work that would have required a period of reflection and introspection. 
5. Oscar Wilde would have had enough privacy to write and revise without distraction. 
6. Wilde's experiences in prison and the time he had to reflect would have influenced the tone and content of De Profundis. 
7. Wilde was known for his literary output, and it was likely that he continued to write during his imprisonment. 
8. De Profundis was written by hand and would have required a certain level of planning in order to ensure that it was complete before Wilde was released from prison.","De Profundis -LRB- Latin : `` from the depths '' -RRB- is a letter written by Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment in Reading Gaol , to `` Bosie '' -LRB- Lord Alfred Douglas -RRB- .   In its first half Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde 's conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency . He indicts both Lord Alfred 's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes . In the second half , Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ , whom he characterises as a romantic , individualist artist . The letter began `` Dear Bosie '' and ended `` Your Affectionate Friend '' .   Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897 , close to the end of his imprisonment . Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision , physical labour and emotional isolation . Nelson , the new prison governor , thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour . He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write `` for medicinal purposes '' ; each page was taken away when completed , and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions . Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897 .   Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross -LRB- another former lover , loyal friend and rival to `` Bosie '' -RRB- . Ross published the letter in 1905 , five years after Wilde 's death , giving it the title `` De Profundis '' from Psalm 130 . It was an incomplete version , excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family ; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde 's letters .

3. Use deductive reasoning:
    Start with a general premise or hypothesis, such as all actors have a certain trait, and then derive specific conclusions from it. For example:

    Use inductive reasoning to identify patterns in the data and draw conclusions. For example:
    Dustin Hoffman has played a variety of roles, such as a mentally ill man in Rain Man (1988), a struggling writer in Midnight Cowboy (1969), and a disabled man in Rain Man (1988).
    Conclusion: Dustin Hoffman is a versatile actor who can play a wide range of characters with different personalities and backgrounds.

Edgar Allan Poe was a horse.,"
1. Edgar Allan Poe was a human being.
    Humans can be identified by certain physical characteristics such as skin, facial features, and height. Therefore, it is assumed that Edgar Allan Poe had these characteristics.

2. Edgar Allan Poe was a real person.
    His existence as a historical figure is well-documented and verified. Therefore, it is assumed that he had a real physical body.

3. Edgar Allan Poe was alive during his time as a writer.
    The claim assumes that Edgar Allan Poe was alive in the 19th century.

4. Edgar Allan Poe owned at least one horse.
    This is inferred from the claim that ""He was the proud owner of a horse.""

5. Horses are a common form of transportation in the 19th century.
    Horse-drawn carriages were a major form of transportation in the 19th century, before the introduction of the automobile. Therefore, it is assumed that Edgar Allan Poe's claim that he was a 'proud owner of a horse' is not simply a literary device, but is based on the common practice of using horses for transportation.

6. Edgar Allan Poe is well-known for his works in the literary genre.
    His works are recognized as important examples of literary genius, and he has been widely celebrated for his contributions to the field. Therefore, it is assumed that his claim to be a horse is not a factual statement about his physical form, but is instead a metaphorical or symbolic statement, representing his status as an artist and writer.

7. Edgar Allan Poe was capable of making a claim of this type.
    He was a prolific writer and known for his use of dark humor, so it is assumed that his claim to be a horse is a deliberate attempt to create a sense of irony or humor in his work.

8. Edgar Allan Poe's claim to be a horse is intended to be taken as a joke.
    His use of the term 'proud owner' suggests that he is taking pride in his status as a horse rather than a human being, which would be a humorous twist on traditional ideas of pride and self-image. Therefore, it is assumed that the claim is intended to challenge the assumptions and stereotypes associated with the idea of a 'human being', and to suggest that other forms of identity and self-expression are valid and worth celebrating.","Edgar Allan Poe -LRB- -LSB- po ä -RSB- born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 -- October 7 , 1849 -RRB- was an American writer , editor , and literary critic . Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories , particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre . He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole , and he was one of the country 's earliest practitioners of the short story . Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction . He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career .   Poe was born in Boston , the second child of two actors . His father abandoned the family in 1810 , and his mother died the following year . Thus orphaned , the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond , Virginia . They never formally adopted him , but Poe was with them well into young adulthood . Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts , including those incurred by gambling , and the cost of secondary education for the young man . Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money . Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name . It was at this time that his publishing career began , albeit humbly , with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems -LRB- 1827 -RRB- , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' . With the death of Frances Allan in 1829 , Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement . However , Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point , declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer , and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan .   Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism . His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City . In Richmond in 1836 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin . In January 1845 , Poe published his poem `` The Raven '' to instant success . His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication . For years , he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn -LRB- later renamed The Stylus -RRB- , though he died before it could be produced . Poe died in Baltimore on October 7 , 1849 , at age 40 ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease , rabies , suicide , tuberculosis , and other agents .   Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world , as well as in specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography . Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature , music , films , and television . A number of his homes are dedicated museums today . The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre . ",REFUTES,"1.

Three species are recognised , the African bush elephant -LRB- Loxodonta africana -RRB- , the African forest elephant -LRB- L. cyclotis -RRB- , and the Asian elephant -LRB- Elephas maximus -RRB- . Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , and Southeast Asia . Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea ; other , now extinct , members of the order include deinotheres , gomphotheres , mammoths , and mastodons . Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m and weigh 7000 kg . All elephants have several distinctive features , the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis , used for many purposes , particularly breathing , lifting water , and grasping objects . Their incisors grow into tusks , which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging . Elephants ' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature . Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight . African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs .   Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs , forests , deserts , and marshes . They prefer to stay near water . They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments . Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators , such as lions , tigers , hyenas , and any wild dogs , usually target only young elephants -LRB- or `` calves '' -RRB- . Females -LRB- `` cows '' -RRB- tend to live in family groups , which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring . The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch , often the oldest cow . Elephants have a fission -- fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise . Males -LRB- `` bulls '' -RRB- leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males . Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth , which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success . Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years . Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild . They communicate by touch , sight , smell , and sound ; elephants use infrasound , and seismic communication over long distances . Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans . They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind .   African elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature -LRB- IUCN -RRB- while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered . One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade , as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks . Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people . Elephants are used as working animals in Asia .

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain -LRB- which lies in the North Atlantic -RRB- in its centre and south ; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly , and the Isle of Wight .   The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law -- the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world -- developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations .

"Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely, and most of those species have not been described.","<ol>
    <li>The definition of ""species"" may vary among researchers.</li>
    <li>It is difficult to count all species because many are microscopic or live deep in the ocean.</li>
    <li>Some species may be extinct or on the brink of extinction.</li>
    <li>Researchers have only been studying some species for a relatively short time.</li>
    <li>New species may be discovered in the future.</li>
    <li>Some species may have gone undiscovered or unrecognized.</li>
    <li>Some species may be endangered or vulnerable to extinction.</li>
    </ol>

Can you provide evidence or examples to support each of the assumptions mentioned here?
Yes, each of the assumptions mentioned above can be supported with evidence and examples. Here are some examples:

1. The definition of ""species"" may vary among researchers: Different taxonomists may have different criteria for defining a species, which can lead to varying estimates of the total number of species.

2. It is difficult to count all species because many are microscopic or live deep in the ocean: Many species are too small or live in inaccessible locations to be easily counted. Estimates of the total number of species rely on extrapolation from limited samples.

3. Some species may be extinct or on the brink of extinction: Many species have been lost to extinction, while others are endangered and at risk of being lost in the future.

4. Researchers have only been studying some species for a relatively short time: Scientific research on the diversity of life on Earth has a relatively short history, and many species have not yet been fully studied.

5. New species may be discovered in the future: Many scientists believe that new species are still being discovered in remote areas of the planet.

6. Some species may have gone undiscovered or unrecognized: Many undiscovered species may be hidden in remote locations, while others may exist but have not yet been recognized by scientists.

7. Some species may be endangered or vulnerable to extinction: Many species are threatened with extinction by human activities like habitat destruction and climate change.","Earth -LRB- from Eor√∞e -LSB- ŒìŒ±·øñŒ± , Gaia -RSB- Terra -RRB- , otherwise known as the World or the Globe , is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life . It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets .   According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence , Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , Earth 's only natural satellite . During one orbit around the Sun , Earth rotates about its axis over 365 times ; thus , an Earth year is about 365.26 days long . Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface . The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides , stabilizes the Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation .   Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years . About 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by its oceans . The remaining 29 % is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes , rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack . Earth 's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth 's magnetic field , and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics .   Within the first billion years of Earth 's history , life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth 's atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms . Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago . Since then , the combination of Earth 's distance from the Sun , physical properties , and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive . In the history of the Earth , biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion , occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events . Over 99 % of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct . Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely ; most species have not been described . Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival . Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures ; politically , the world has about 200 sovereign states . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported - The passage states that ""Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described,"" which suggests that there is a variation in the definition of ""species"" among researchers.

2. Supported - The passage mentions that Earth's surface is mostly covered with water, and that there are many lakes, rivers, and other sources of water. It also states that the majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. These conditions make it difficult to count all species, especially those that are microscopic or live deep in the ocean.

3. Supported - The passage mentions that over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. This supports the statement that some species may be extinct or on the brink of extinction.

4. Supported - The passage states that ""Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans,"" which suggests that researchers have only been studying some species for a relatively short time.

5. Supported - The passage mentions that ""most species have not been described,"" which suggests that new species may be discovered in the future.

6. Supported - The passage states that ""most species have not been described,"" which suggests that some species may have gone undiscovered or unrecognized.

His work was characterized by nonconformity , free-form improvisation , sound experiments , musical virtuosity , and satire of American culture . In a career spanning more than 30 years , Zappa composed rock , pop , jazz , jazz fusion , orchestral and musique concr√®te works , and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist . Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos , and designed album covers . He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his generation .   As a self-taught composer and performer , Zappa 's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize . While in his teens , he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Var√®se , Igor Stravinsky , and Anton Webern , along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music . He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands ; later switching to electric guitar . His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention , Freak Out ! , combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages . He continued this eclectic and experimental approach , irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock , jazz or classical .   Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed `` Project/Object '' , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums . His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes , structures and movements , often humorously so . He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion , and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech , self-education , political participation and the abolition of censorship . Unlike many other rock musicians of his era , he personally disapproved of and seldom used drugs , but supported their decriminalization and regulation .   During Zappa 's lifetime , he was a highly productive and prolific artist , earning widespread acclaim from critics and fellow musicians . He had some commercial success , particularly in Europe , and worked as an independent artist for most of his career . He remains a major influence on musicians and composers . His honors include an induction into the 1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . In 2000 , he was ranked number 36 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock . In 2004 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at number 71 on its list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' , and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the `` 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time '' .

Generation X has no precise date for its cohort.,"
<ol>
<li>The definition of Generation X is not clear, and there is no consensus among researchers.</li>
<li>Some researchers define Generation X as people born between 1965 and 1980, which would give them a precise date for their cohort.</li>
<li>Some researchers define Generation X as people who came of age during the 1980s and 1990s, which is a more subjective definition that does not lend itself to easy measurement.</li>
<li>If there is no widely accepted definition of Generation X, then it is difficult for researchers to measure when they were born and when they came of age.</li>
<li>This lack of precision is likely a source of confusion among researchers, and contributes to the lack of agreement about when Generation X begins and ends.</li>
<li>This ambiguity is also likely to make it difficult to conduct research on Generation X, as it makes it difficult to define the sample.</li>
<li>If there are no clear boundaries for Generation X, then research on this demographic group may be limited to qualitative studies or self-reported information, rather than quantitative data.</li>
</ol>","Generation X , or Gen X , is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers . There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends ; demographers and researchers typically use starting birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s and ending birth years ranging from the late 1970s to early 1980s . Generation X is a relatively smaller demographic cohort sandwiched between two larger demographic cohorts , the baby boomers and the millennials .   Members of Generation X were children during a time of shifting societal values and as children were sometimes called the `` latchkey generation '' , due to reduced adult supervision compared to previous generations , a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce , prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside of the home . As adolescents and young adults , they were dubbed the `` MTV Generation '' -LRB- a reference to the music video channel of the same name -RRB- and characterized as slackers and as cynical and disaffected . Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of grunge and hip hop music , and indie films .

In 1968 , he won the European Cup with Manchester United , and was named the European Footballer of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year . The Irish Football Association described him as the `` greatest player to ever pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland '' .   Born and brought up in Belfast , Best began his club career in England with Manchester United , with the scout who had spotted his talent at the age of 15 sending a telegram to manager Matt Busby which read : `` I think I 've found you a genius . '' After making his debut for United aged 17 , he scored 179 goals from 470 appearances over 11 years , and was the club 's top goalscorer in the league for five consecutive seasons .   One of the greatest dribblers of all time , his playing style combined pace , skill , balance , feints , two-footedness , goalscoring and the ability to beat defenders . Best unexpectedly quit United in 1974 at age 27 , but returned to football for a number of clubs around the world in short spells , until retiring in 1984 , age 37 . In international football , he was capped 37 times and scored nine goals between 1964 and 1977 , although a combination of the team 's performance and his lack of fitness in 1982 meant that he never played in the finals of a European Championship or World Cup .   Best was one of the first celebrity footballers , earning the nickname `` El Beatle '' in 1966 , but his subsequent extravagant lifestyle led to various problems , most notably alcoholism , which he suffered from for the rest of his life . These issues affected him on and off the field , at times causing controversy . He said of his career : `` I spent a lot of money on booze , birds -LSB- women -RSB- and fast cars -- the rest I just squandered '' . After football , he spent some time as a football analyst , but his financial and health problems continued into his retirement . He died in 2005 , age 59 , due to complications from the immunosuppressive drugs he needed to take after a liver transplant in 2002 . Best was married twice , to two former models , Angie Best and then Alex Best . His son Calum Best was born in 1981 from his first marriage .   Before he died , Best was voted 8th in the World Soccer 100 greatest football players of the 20th century election in 1999 and was voted 16th in the IFFHS World Player of the Century election in 1999 . He was on the six man short list for the BBC 's Sports Personality of the Century in 1999 . Best was one of the inaugural 22 inductees into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 . In 2004 , he was voted 19th in the public UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world 's greatest living players . Former Brazilian footballer Pel√© stated , `` George Best was the greatest player in the world '' . Best was once quoted as saying , `` Pel√© called me the greatest footballer in the world . That is the ultimate salute to my life . '' On what would have been his 60th birthday , Belfast City Airport was renamed the George Best Belfast City Airport . According to the BBC , Best was remembered by mourners at his public funeral held in Belfast as `` the beautiful boy '' -LSB- with a -RSB- `` beautiful game '' .   Mark Garnett and Richard Weight have explored the enduring appeal of George Best .

He was the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth .   Known as Albert until his accession , George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria , and was named after his great-grandfather Albert , Prince Consort . As the second son of King George V , he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother , Edward . He attended naval college as a teenager , and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War . In 1920 , he was made Duke of York . He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters , Elizabeth and Margaret . In the mid-1920s , he had speech therapy for a stammer , which he never fully overcame .   George 's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936 . However , later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king . Edward abdicated in order to marry , and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor .   During George 's reign , the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated . The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country 's constitution on the day of his accession . The following year , a new Irish constitution changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of President . From 1939 , the Empire and Commonwealth -- except Ireland -- was at war with Nazi Germany . War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941 , respectively . Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945 , the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined . After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , George remained king of both countries , but relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 . Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949 , and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year . George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth . He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign . He was succeeded by his eldest daughter , Elizabeth II . ",REFUTES,"1.

He graduated from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Baltimore School of Law , and was then drafted into the United States Army in 1941 , serving as an officer during the Second World War and later being recalled for service during the Korean War in 1950 . Agnew worked as an aide for U.S. Representative James Devereux before he was appointed to the Baltimore County Board of Zoning Appeals in 1957 . In 1960 , he lost an election for the Baltimore City Circuit Court , but in 1962 was elected Baltimore County Executive . In 1966 , Agnew was elected the 55th Governor of Maryland , defeating his Democratic opponent George P. Mahoney .

Gold has a distinctive color.,"(Assumption number, assumption)
    1. Gold has a unique atomic structure that gives it a distinct yellow color.
    2. Gold is a good reflector of light.
    3. The human eye has evolved to recognize gold as a distinct color from other colors.
    4. The color of gold has been associated with wealth and beauty throughout human history.
    5. People in different cultures and societies may have different associations with the color gold.
    6. The color gold is used in many different contexts, such as jewelry, art, and currency design.
    7. The chemical properties of gold can affect the color of gold alloys and compounds.
    8. The color of gold can be influenced by the environment, such as oxidation or tarnishing.","Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au -LRB- from aurum -RRB- and atomic number 79 . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental -LRB- native -RRB- form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver -LRB- as electrum -RRB- and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium -LRB- gold tellurides -RRB- .   Gold 's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher numbered , naturally occurring elements . It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis , from the collision of neutron stars , and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed . Because the Earth was molten when it was formed , almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core . Therefore , most of the gold that is present today in the Earth 's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later , by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment , about 4 billion years ago .   Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction .

Gold is resistant to all acids except aqua regia.,"
1. The claim assumes that gold is a chemical element with atomic number 79.
2. The claim assumes that all acids are chemical compounds that contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
3. The claim assumes that acids can dissolve metals and other materials to create their salts and ions.
4. The claim assumes that the reactivity of acids towards gold depends on their chemical composition and strength.
5. The claim assumes that some acids may be more reactive towards gold than others, but that there is no acid that cannot be corrosive towards gold.
6. The claim assumes that there is a chemical compound called aqua regia which can dissolve gold.
7. The claim assumes that the assumption 6 is based on the chemical composition of the compound and its ability to dissolve gold.
8. The claim assumes that the above statement is accurate and that all of the assumptions mentioned above are true.","Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au -LRB- from aurum -RRB- and atomic number 79 . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental -LRB- native -RRB- form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver -LRB- as electrum -RRB- and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium -LRB- gold tellurides -RRB- .   Gold 's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher numbered , naturally occurring elements . It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis , from the collision of neutron stars , and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed . Because the Earth was molten when it was formed , almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core . Therefore , most of the gold that is present today in the Earth 's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later , by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment , about 4 billion years ago .   Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction .   Historically , the value of gold was rooted in its relative rarity , easy handling and minting , easy smelting and fabrication , resistance to corrosion and other chemical reactions -LRB- nobility -RRB- and its distinctive color .

The author of Gone with the Wind had access to reliable information about the convention used to classify fiction by length.","Gone with the Wind is a novel by American writer Margaret Mitchell , first published in 1936 . The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta , both in Georgia , during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era . It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara , the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner , who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman 's destructive `` March to the Sea '' . This historical novel features a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story , with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson .   Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the outset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937 . As of 2014 , a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers , just behind the Bible . More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide .   Written from the perspective of the slaveholder , Gone with the Wind is Southern plantation fiction . Its portrayal of slavery and African Americans has been considered controversial , especially by succeeding generations , as well as its use of a racial epithet and ethnic slurs common to the period . However , the novel has become a reference point for subsequent writers about the South , both black and white . Scholars at American universities refer to it in their writings , interpret and study it . The novel has been absorbed into American popular culture .   Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1937 . It was adapted into a 1939 American film . Gone with the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime .   Mitchell used color symbolism , especially the colors red and green , which frequently are associated with Scarlett O'Hara . Mitchell identified the primary theme as survival . She left the ending speculative for the reader , however . She was often asked what became of her lovers , Rhett and Scarlett . She replied , `` For all I know , Rhett may have found someone else who was less difficult . '' Two sequels authorized by Mitchell 's estate were published more than a half century later . A parody was also produced . ",SUPPORTS,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO - The evidence does not provide any information about the length of Gone with the Wind or how it relates to its status as fiction.

The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation 's second - and fifth-most populous urban regions , respectively . California also has the nation 's most populous county , Los Angeles County , and its largest county by area , San Bernardino County .   California 's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east ; and from the redwood -- Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast . The Central Valley , a major agricultural area , dominates the state 's center . Though California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate , the large size of the state means it can vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north , to arid desert in the interior , as well as snowy alpine in the mountains .   What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries . The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony . The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence , but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican -- American War . The western portion of Alta California then was organized as the State of California , and admitted as the 31st state on September 9 , 1850 . The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes , with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom .

'' The show was influential in its extensive use of smash cuts : sudden , short cuts to unrelated scenes showing something the characters are briefly discussing . 30 Rock also became known for its dedication to making these extremely elaborate , once showing a set that took three days to build for only six seconds of video .   30 Rock received critical acclaim throughout its run , winning several major awards -LRB- including Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 and nominations for every other year it ran -RRB- , and appearing on many critics ' year-end `` best of '' 2006-2013 lists . On July 14 , 2009 , the series was nominated for 22 Primetime Emmy Awards , the most in a single year for a comedy series . Over the course of the series , it was nominated for 103 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 16 , in addition to numerous other nominations and wins from other awards shows . Despite the high praise , the series struggled in the ratings throughout its run , something of which Fey herself has made light .   In 2009 , Comedy Central and WGN America bought the syndication rights to the show , which began airing on both networks on September 19 , 2011 ; the series also entered into local broadcast syndication on the same day . Today , 30 Rock is regarded as a landmark series . Its series finale in particular has been named as one of the greatest in television history by several publications . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America named 30 Rock the 21st best-written television series of all time . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Guam was employed by America.,"(Note that you may make assumptions that are true but that do not appear in the claim.)

There are several assumptions that can be made when producing the claim that Guam was employed by America:

1. Guam and America are two distinct entities.

2. The employment was a conscious and intentional action made by one entity or the other.

3. Guam was employed by America as a worker or employee, rather than a volunteer or contractor.

4. There was some sort of remuneration or compensation for the work done, and the employment was not simply a form of slavery or exploitation.

5. There was a specific period of time during which Guam was employed by America, rather than a general sense of ongoing employment.

6. This employment was legal and not in violation of any laws or treaties between Guam and America.

7. There were no other factors or circumstances that could have led to Guam being described in the way that it was. For example, Guam could have been working for America in a particular field or industry, but not specifically employed as a single entity.

8. The claim is based on a factual basis, rather than a hypothetical or speculative one.","Guam -LRB- -LSB- Àà…°w…ëÀêm -RSB- or -LSB- Àà…°w…ím -RSB- Chamorro : Gu√•h√•n -LSB- Àà…° ∑…ëh…ën -RSB- formally the Territory of Guam -RRB- is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States .

The book was released on 21 July 2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom , in the United States by Scholastic , and in Canada by Raincoast Books , ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone . The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort , as well as revealing the previously concealed back story of several main characters . The title of the book refers to three mythical objects featured in the story , collectively known as the `` Deathly Hallows '' -- an unbeatable wand , a stone to bring the dead to life , and a cloak of invisibility .   Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007 . Before its release , Bloomsbury reportedly spent # 10 million to keep the book 's contents safe before its release date . American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review , although two reviews were submitted early . Shortly before release , photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed , leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it .   Released globally in 93 countries , Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever , a record it still held in 2012 . It sold 15 million copies in the first 24 hours following its release , including more than 11 million in the U.S. and UK alone . The previous record , 9 million in its first day , had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . The novel has also been translated into over 120 languages . The title proved difficult to translate and was often rendered closer to `` Harry Potter and the Relics of Death '' in other languages .   Major themes in the novel are death and living in a corrupted society , and critics have compared them to Christian allegories . Generally well-received , the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award , and the American Library Association named it a `` Best Book for Young Adults '' . A two-part film adaptation began showing in November 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1 was released ; Part 2 was released on 15 July 2011 . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

"History of art includes architecture, dance, sculpture, music, painting, poetry literature, theatre, narrative, film, photography and graphic arts.","
Assumptions made:
1. A wide range of art forms are included under the umbrella term of 'history of art.'
2. Each art form has unique characteristics and contributes to the overall development of culture.
3. The history of art has been heavily influenced by changes in politics, society, and technology.
4. There are various ways to classify and categorize the different art forms.
5. The study of history of art has important implications for understanding the past and shaping the future.
6. The definition of art can differ depending on cultural and historical contexts.
7. The different art forms have their own artistic canons, movements, and stylistic periods.
8. Art appreciation is subjective and can vary among individuals and cultures.","The history of art is the history of any activity or product made by humans in a visual form for aesthetical or communicative purposes , expressing ideas , emotions or , in general , a worldview . Over time visual art has been classified in diverse ways , from the medieval distinction between liberal arts and mechanical arts , to the modern distinction between fine arts and applied arts , or to the many contemporary definitions , which define art as a manifestation of human creativity . The subsequent expansion of the list of principal arts in the 20th century reached to nine : architecture , dance , sculpture , music , painting , poetry -LRB- described broadly as a form of literature with aesthetic purpose or function , which also includes the distinct genres of theatre and narrative -RRB- , film , photography and graphic arts . In addition to the old forms of artistic expression such as fashion and gastronomy , new modes of expression are being considered as arts such as video , computer art , performance , advertising , animation , television and videogames .   The history of art is a multidisciplinary branch of the arts and sciences , seeking an objective examination of art throughout time , classifying cultures , establishing periodizations , and observing the distinctive and influential characteristics of art . The study of the history of art was initially developed during the Renaissance , with its limited scope being the artistic production of Western civilization . However , as time has passed , it has imposed a broader view of artistic history , seeking a comprehensive overview of all the civilizations and analysis of their artistic production in terms of their own cultural values -LRB- cultural relativism -RRB- , and not just western art history .   Today , art enjoys a wide network of study , dissemination and preservation of all the artistic legacy of mankind throughout history . The 20th century has seen the proliferation of institutions , foundations , art museums and galleries , in both the public and private sectors , dedicated to the analysis and cataloging of works of art as well as exhibitions aimed at a mainstream audience . The rise of media has been crucial in improving the study and dissemination of art . International events and exhibitions like the Whitney Biennial and biennales of Venice and S√£o Paulo or the Documenta of Kassel have helped the development of new styles and trends . Prizes such as the Turner of the Tate Gallery , the Wolf Prize in Arts , the Pritzker Prize of architecture , the Pulitzer of photography and the Oscar of cinema also promote the best creative work on an international level .

6. It is assumed that Huginn is a raven and not another type of bird.
7. It is assumed that there is a connection between Huginn and Odin beyond their traveling companions.
8. It is assumed that Odin is a prominent figure in Norse mythology and is well-known to the reader.","In Germanic mythology , Odin -LRB- from Old Norse √ì√∞inn -RRB- is a widely revered god . In Norse mythology , from which stems most of the information about the god , Odin is associated with healing , death , royalty , the gallows , knowledge , battle , sorcery , poetry , frenzy , and the runic alphabet , and is the husband of the goddess Frigg . In wider Germanic mythology and paganism , Odin was known in Old English as W≈çden , in Old Saxon as W≈çdan , and in Old High German as Wuotan or W≈çtan , all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym w≈çƒëanaz .   Odin is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples , from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania through the tribal expansions of the Migration Period and the Viking Age . In the modern period , Odin continued to be acknowledged in the rural folklore of Germanic Europe . References to Odin appear in place names throughout regions historically inhabited by the ancient Germanic peoples , and the day of the week Wednesday bears his name in many Germanic languages , including English .   In Anglo-Saxon England , Odin held a particular place as a euhemerized ancestral figure among royalty , and he is frequently referred to as a founding figure among various other Germanic peoples , including the Langobards . Forms of his name appear frequently throughout the Germanic record , though narratives regarding Odin are mainly found in Old Norse works recorded in Iceland , primarily around the 13th century . These texts make up the bulk of modern understanding of Norse mythology .   In Old Norse texts , Odin is depicted as one-eyed and long-bearded , frequently wielding a spear named Gungnir , and wearing a cloak and a broad hat . He is often accompanied by his animal companions -- the wolves Geri and Freki and the ravens Huginn and Muninn , who bring him information from all over Midgard -- and rides the flying , eight-legged steed Sleipnir across the sky and into the underworld . Odin is attested as having many sons , most famously the gods Thor -LRB- with J√∂r√∞ -RRB- and Baldr -LRB- with Frigg -RRB- , and is known by hundreds of names . In these texts , he frequently seeks greater knowledge , at times in disguise -LRB- most famously by obtaining the Mead of Poetry -RRB- , makes wagers with his wife Frigg over the outcome of exploits , and takes part in both the creation of the world by way of slaying the primordial being Ymir and the gift of life to the first two humans Ask and Embla . Odin has a particular association with Yule , and mankind 's knowledge of both the runes and poetry is also attributed to him .   In Old Norse texts , Odin is given primacy over female beings associated with the battlefield -- the valkyries -- and oversees Valhalla , where he receives half of those who die in battle , the einherjar . The other half are chosen by the goddess Freyja for her afterlife location , F√≥lkvangr . Odin consults the disembodied , herb-embalmed head of the wise being M√≠mir for advice , and during the foretold events of Ragnar√∂k , Odin is told to lead the einherjar into battle before being consumed by the monstrous wolf Fenrir . In later folklore , Odin appears as a leader of the Wild Hunt , a ghostly procession of the dead through the winter sky . He has also been associated with charms and other forms of magic , particularly in Old English and Old Norse texts .   Odin has been a frequent subject of study in Germanic studies , and numerous theories have been put forward regarding his development . Some of these focus on Odin 's particular relation to other figures ; for example , the fact that Freyja 's husband √ì√∞r appears to be something of an etymological doublet of the god , whereas Odin 's wife Frigg is in many ways similar to Freyja , and that Odin has a particular relation to the figure of Loki . Other approaches focus on Odin 's place in the historical record , a frequent question being whether the figure of Odin derives from Proto-Indo-European religion , or whether he developed later in Germanic society . In the modern period , Odin has inspired numerous works of poetry , music , and other forms of media . He is venerated in most forms of the new religious movement Heathenry , together with other gods venerated by the ancient Germanic peoples ; some branches focus particularly on him .

8.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby , the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk -LRB- May 1962 -RRB- . In his comic book appearances , the character is both the Hulk , a green-skinned , hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength , and his alter ego Bruce Banner , a physically weak , socially withdrawn , and emotionally reserved physicist , the two existing as personalities independent and resenting of the other .   Following his accidental exposure to gamma radiation during the detonation of an experimental bomb , Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress , at or against his will , often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner 's civilian life . The Hulk 's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger . Commonly portrayed as a raging savage , the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner 's fractured psyche , from a mindless , destructive force , to a brilliant warrior , or genius scientist in his own right . Despite both Hulk and Banner 's desire for solitude , the character has a large supporting cast , including Banner 's lover Betty Ross , his friend Rick Jones , his cousin She-Hulk , sons Hiro-Kala and Skaar , and his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers . However , his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others .   Lee stated that the Hulk 's creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .

8. The effectiveness of the treatment may vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition.","Hypothyroidism , also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid , is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone . It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , constipation , depression , and weight gain . Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre . Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby , which is called cretinism .   Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . In countries with enough iodine in the diet , the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Less common causes include : previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone -LRB- TSH -RRB- and thyroxine levels .   Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization . Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine . The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy . While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important , excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism .

    - Competitions can consist of one or multiple rounds.
    - Teams with the highest number of points are declared the winners.
    - Ice hockey has established rules and regulations to be followed during competitions.
    - Teams have coaches and training facilities to prepare for competitions.
    </ol>","Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice , usually in a rink , in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent 's net to score points . The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical , with teams usually consisting of six players each : one goaltender , and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team .   Ice hockey is most popular in Canada , central and eastern Europe , Scandinavia , and the northern regions of the United States . Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada , where the modern version of the sport was created , and enjoys immense popularity ; alongside Canada , hockey is the most popular winter sport in Finland , Latvia , the Czech Republic , Sweden , Slovakia , Belarus and Switzerland . In North America , the National Hockey League -LRB- NHL -RRB- is the highest level for men 's hockey and the most popular . The Kontinental Hockey League -LRB- KHL -RRB- is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe . The International Ice Hockey Federation -LRB- IIHF -RRB- is the formal governing body for international ice hockey , with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking . Worldwide , there are ice hockey federations in 74 countries .   Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th century United Kingdom and elsewhere . These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed , such as `` shinny '' and `` ice polo '' . The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada , most notably in Montreal , where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3 , 1875 . Some characteristics of that game , such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck , have been retained to this day . Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s , and professional ice hockey originated around 1900 . The Stanley Cup , emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy , was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL . In the early 1900s , the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace , the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time in the Olympics in the Olympic Games of 1920 .   In international competitions , the national teams of six countries -LRB- the `` Big Six '' -RRB- predominate : Canada , Czech Republic , Finland , Russia , Sweden and the United States . Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men 's competition at the Olympics , only six medals were not awarded to one of those countries . In the annual Ice Hockey World Championships , 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations . Teams outside the `` Big Six '' have won only five medals in either competition since 1953 : All 12 Women 's Olympic and 36 IIHF World Women 's Championships medals have been awarded to one of these six countries , and every gold medal in both competitions has been won by either the Canadian national team or the United States national team .   In Canada , the United States , and some European countries it is known simply as hockey ; the name `` ice hockey '' is used in places where `` hockey '' more often refers to field hockey , such as South America , Asia , Africa , Australasia , and some European countries . In Russia and Ukraine , where `` hockey '' can also refer to bandy , ice hockey is often called `` hockey with puck '' . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

2. The Ilkhanate was founded by Kublai Khan, who was the grandson of Genghis Khan.
3. The Ilkhanate was divided into smaller administrative areas, such as khanates, which were ruled by Ilkhanate governors.
4. Haiti was not included in any of the khanates that made up the Ilkhanate.
5. The Ilkhanate did not have any direct control over Haiti or the surrounding Caribbean area during its existence.
6. The claim does not take into account any indirect connections between the Ilkhanate and Haiti, such as trade or diplomatic relations.
7. The claim does not consider any potential cultural or historical connections between the Mongol Empire and the Caribbean or Haiti.
8. The claim only focuses on the specific period of time when the Ilkhanate existed, from the late 13th century to the late 14th century.","The Ilkhanate , also spelled Il-khanate -LRB- ÿß€åŸÑÿÆÿßŸÜÿßŸÜ , IlkhƒÅnƒÅn ; –•“Ø–ª—ç–≥–∏–π–Ω —É–ª—Å , Hulagu-yn Ulus -RRB- , was established as a khanate that formed the southwestern sector of the Mongol Empire , ruled by the Mongol House of Hulagu .

The Ilkhanate was originally based on the campaigns of Genghis Khan in the Khwarazmian Empire in 1219 -- 24 and was founded by Hulagu Khan , a grandson of Genghis Khan . With the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire after 1259 it became a functionally separate khanate . At its greatest extent , the state expanded into territories that today comprise most of Iran , Iraq , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Turkmenistan , Turkey , western Afghanistan , and southwestern Pakistan .

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page , singer Robert Plant , bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . The band 's heavy , guitar-driven sound , rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums , has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences , including folk music .   After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group was initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin II -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin III -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin IV -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , Houses of the Holy -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , and Physical Graffiti -LRB- 1975 -RRB- . Their fourth album , which features the track `` Stairway to Heaven '' , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and it helped to secure the group 's popularity .   Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones ' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions .

"In Burundi, there are 21 registered parties.","- It is assumed that the source of the data is reliable and accurate.
    - It is also assumed that all registered parties have been included in the data and that no registered parties have been omitted.
    - It is assumed that the number of registered parties is a good indication of the overall political landscape in Burundi. However, it is possible that there may be other parties or groups that are not registered but still have an impact on the political climate.
    - It is also assumed that the number of registered parties in Burundi is not changing rapidly or significantly, and that it represents a stable political environment. It is possible that changes in the political landscape could lead to changes in the number of registered parties.
    - It is further assumed that Burundi is a democratic nation in which political parties play a significant role in shaping the political landscape. However, this assumption could be challenged if Burundi were not a democratic nation or if there were significant restrictions on the role of political parties in the political system.

What additional information or data would be needed to verify or challenge these assumptions?</s> 
To verify or challenge the assumptions mentioned above, additional information or data related to Burundi's political system and the role of registered parties in shaping the political landscape would be necessary. This could include data on the frequency of party registrations, the level of influence that registered parties have on the political system, the number and types of parties that have been excluded from registration or from participating in elections, and the level of support that registered parties have among the electorate. It would also be important to understand Burundi's history and politics, as well as the legal and regulatory framework for political parties and elections, in order to assess the accuracy and relevance of the assumptions made.","Burundi -LRB- -LSB- b…ôÀàr ändi -RSB- or -LSB- b…ôÀàr åndi -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Republic of Burundi -LRB- Republika y' Uburundi , -LSB- buÀà…æundi -RSB- R√©publique du Burundi , -LSB- bu Åundi -RSB- or -LSB- by Åyndi -RSB- -RRB- , is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of East Africa , bordered by Rwanda to the north , Tanzania to the east and south , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . It is also considered part of Central Africa . Burundi 's capital is Bujumbura . The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika .   The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation .   Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the world 's poorest . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .   Burundi 's political system is that of a presidential representative democratic republic based upon a multi-party state . The President of Burundi is the head of state and head of government . There are currently 21 registered parties in Burundi . On 13 March 1992 , Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution , which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition . Six years later , on 6 June 1998 , the constitution was changed , broadening National Assembly 's seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents . Because of the Arusha Accord , Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000 . In October 2016 , Burundi informed the UN of its intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court .   Burundi remains an overwhelmingly rural society , with just 13 % of the population living in urban areas in 2013 . The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre -LRB- 753 per sq mi -RRB- is the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa . Roughly 85 % of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin , 15 % are Tutsi , and fewer than 1 % are indigenous Twa -LRB- or Pygmies -RRB- . The official languages of Burundi are French and Kirundi , although Swahili can be found spoken along the Tanzanian border .   One of the smallest countries in Africa , Burundi has an equatorial climate . Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift , the western extension of the East African Rift . The country lies on a rolling plateau in the centre of Africa . The highest peak , Mount Heha at 8810 ft , lies to the southeast of the capital , Bujumbura . The source of the River Nile is in Bururi province , and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika , located in much of Burundi 's southwestern corner . There are two national parks , Kibira National Park to the northwest -LRB- a small region of rain forest , adjacent to Nyungwe Forest National Park in Rwanda -RRB- , Ruvubu National Park to the northeast -LRB- along the Rurubu River , also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu -RRB- . Both were established in 1982 to conserve wildlife populations . Burundi 's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture .   Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation , soil erosion and habitat loss . Deforestation of the entire country is almost completely due to overpopulation , with a mere 230 mi2 remaining and an ongoing loss of about 9 % per annum . In addition to poverty , Burundians often have to deal with corruption , weak infrastructure , poor access to health and education services , and hunger . Burundi is densely populated and has had substantial emigration as young people seek opportunities elsewhere . The World Happiness Report 2017 ranked Burundi as the world 's second least happy nation with a rank of 154 . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Indiana Jones has only been portrayed by Harrison Ford.,"
1. Harrison Ford has had the most notable and successful career as Indiana Jones, therefore it is assumed that he is the only actor who has portrayed the character. 
2. There are no other actors who have portrayed Indiana Jones in any of the movies or media that make up the franchise. 
3. The franchise consists only of movies and media that feature Harrison Ford as the character. 
4. Any media that portrays Indiana Jones with a different actor (e.g. video games, novels, comics) are deemed non-canonical and not officially part of the franchise by the creators or the community. 
5. The assumption is that Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indiana Jones has been so definitive that it has become synonymous with the character, to the point that any other actor attempting to play the role would be seen as inferior. 
6. No other actors have been publicly considered or approached to portray Indiana Jones outside of the movies/media that make up the franchise. 
7. Harrison Ford is not deceased or retired from acting and is still capable of playing the character if the franchise were to resume. 
8. The assumption is that no other actor would be able to fill the role in the same way as Harrison Ford, as they would likely have their own interpretation of the character, leading to a lack of continuity.</s> 
How does the assumption that there are no other actors who have portrayed Indiana Jones in any of the movies/media that make up the franchise affect the public perception of the character and the franchise?</s> 
The assumption that Harrison Ford is the only actor associated with Indiana Jones reinforces the idea that Harrison Ford's portrayal is the definitive one and sets a high standard for any future actors who may take on the role. This assumption also limits the creativity and possibilities when it comes to the character and how it can be interpreted. If another actor were to take on the role, it would be seen as a departure from the original portrayal and could potentially alienate die-hard fans of the franchise. Additionally, the assumption that Harrison Ford is the only actor associated with Indiana Jones could affect the legacy of the character and the franchise as a whole. If other actors were to portray the character, it could dilute the brand and potentially devalue the character's impact and significance in popular culture. Therefore, the assumption that there are no other actors who have portrayed Indiana Jones has a significant impact on the public perception and legacy of the character and the franchise.","Henry Walton `` Indiana '' Jones Jr. -LRB- also shortened to Indy -RRB- is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Indiana Jones franchise .

8. The claim assumes that the variety of life is threatened by human activities and environmental changes.</s> 
What specific human activities and environmental changes are threatening the variety of life in Indonesia's wilderness?</s> 
Some specific human activities and environmental changes that are threatening the variety of life in Indonesia's wilderness include deforestation, mining, oil exploration, agricultural expansion, pollution, overfishing, and climate change. These activities are causing habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and environmental degradation, which are all significant threats to the biodiversity of Indonesia's wilderness. Additionally, the introduction of invasive species and unsustainable resource use are also contributing to the decline in the variety of life in Indonesia's wilderness. It is essential to address these issues through conservation initiatives and sustainable policies to protect the country's natural resources and the biodiversity they support.","Biodiversity a portmanteau of `` biological diversity , '' generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth .

Interstellar is a narrative in a visual medium.,"(Assume that the claim is true and try to identify any assumptions made in the production of this narrative)
    1. The creators of the narrative believed that the visual medium of film is an effective means of storytelling.
    2. The creators of the narrative believed that the narrative they wanted to tell required visuals in order to be fully communicated.
    3. The creators of the narrative believed that the visuals needed to be of a certain style and quality to be effective.
    4. The creators of the narrative believed that the audience would be able to understand and engage with the visual language of the film.
    5. The creators of the film believed that it would be successful with a certain demographic.
    6. The creators of the film believed that the film would be profitable.
    7. The creators of the film believed that the film would have a lasting impact on the audience.
    8. The creators of the film believed that the story would resonate with audiences and be relevant across generations.

What is an example of a visual medium that could not effectively communicate the claim that Interstellar is a narrative and why would that be?</s> 
For example, an audio-only medium such as a podcast or radio show would not effectively communicate the narrative of Interstellar, because the visuals are integral to the storytelling. In order to convey the themes, plot points, and characters, the audience would need to see the visual imagery that is present in the film. Therefore, an audio-only medium cannot adequately convey the message of the film, and the claim that Interstellar is a narrative would not be effectively communicated without visuals.","Use mdy dates  date = May 2016 Interstellar is a 2014 British-American epic science fiction film directed , co-written , and co-produced by Christopher Nolan .

It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia , the de facto Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan ; to the north by the Caspian Sea ; to the northeast by Turkmenistan ; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan ; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman ; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq . Comprising a land area of 1648195 km2 , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world . Officially with 79.93 million inhabitants -LRB- Nov 2016 -RRB- , Iran is the world 's 18th-most-populous country . It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline . The country 's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia , and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz , make it of great geostrategic importance . Iran has diverse landscapes and geographical conditions . Tehran is the country 's capital and largest city , as well as its leading economic and cultural center .   Iran is home to one of the world 's oldest civilizations , beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the 4th millennium BC . The area was first unified and dominated by the Iranian Medes in the 7th century BC . Iran reached its greatest extent during the Achaemenid Empire -LRB- First Persian Empire -RRB- founded by Cyrus the Great in 6th century BC , the largest empire the world had yet seen , stretching from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley . Persia fell to Alexander the Great in 4th century BC , but reemerged shortly after as the Parthian Empire . Under the Sassanians , Persia became a leading world power for the next four centuries .   In 7th century AD , Arabs conquered Persia and largely displaced the indigenous faiths of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism with the new religion of Islam . Iranians became major contributors to the Islamic Golden Age that followed , producing many influential scientists , scholars , artists and thinkers . After two centuries , a period of various Iranian dynasties began , although these dynasties were later conquered by Turks and then the Mongols . An Iranian national identity was always reasserted however , developing a distinct cultural entity . The rise of the Safavids in 15th century led to the establishment of Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion , marking a turning point in Muslim history . In the 18th century , Iran arguably possessed briefly the most powerful military at the time under Nader Shah . Conflicts with the Russian Empire in 19th century led to significant territorial losses . Popular unrest culminated in the Persian Constitutional Revolution , which established a constitutional monarchy and the country 's first legislative body , the Majles . Following a coup d'√©tat instigated by the UK and the US in 1953 , Iran gradually became closely aligned with the West and grew increasingly autocratic . Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of an Islamic republic , a political system which combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a theocracy governed by Islamic jurists under the concept of a `` Supreme Leadership '' . According to international observers , the current Iranian government is oppressive , with human rights abuses commonplace .   A multicultural country comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups , most inhabitants of Iran are Shia Muslims and Persian is the official language . The largest ethnic groups in Iran are the Persians , Azeris , Kurds and Lurs .   Iran is a founding member of the UN , ECO , NAM , OIC , and OPEC . Iran is a major regional and middle power , and its large reserves of fossil fuels -- which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves -- exert considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy . Iran 's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites , the third-largest number in Asia and 11th-largest in the world . ",SUPPORTS,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO

Osiris 's death and rebirth was relived each year through rituals . The worship of Isis eventually spread throughout the Greco-Roman world , continuing until the suppression of paganism in the Christian era .

This approach allows you to clearly state your assumptions and provide justification for why they support your claim. It also allows the reader to see the logic behind your argument and evaluate whether they agree with your assumptions.","Italy -LRB- Italia -LSB- iÀàtaÀêlja -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Italian Republic -LRB- -LSB- Repubblica italiana , links = no -RSB- -RRB- , is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.The Italian peninsula is geographically located in Southern Europe , while North Italy can be placed partly or totally in Central Europe . Due to cultural , political and historical reasons , Italy is a Western European country . Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea , Italy shares open land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , San Marino and Vatican City . Italy covers an area of 301338 km2 and has a largely temperate seasonal and Mediterranean climate . Due to its shape , it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale -LRB- the Boot -RRB- . With 61 million inhabitants , it is the fourth most populous EU member state .   Since classical times , ancient Phoenicians , Carthaginians and Greeks established settlements in the south of Italy , with Etruscans and Celts inhabiting the centre and north of Italy respectively and various different ancient Italian tribes and Italic peoples dispersed throughout the Italian Peninsula and insular Italy . The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom , which eventually became a republic that conquered and assimilated other nearby civilisations . Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean basin , conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural , political and religious centre of Western civilisation . The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law , republican governments , Christianity and the Latin script .   During the Middle Ages , Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions , but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping , commerce and banking , laying down the groundwork for modern capitalism . These independent statelets , acting as Europe 's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East , often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy and wealth in comparison to the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe at the time , though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States , while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century , partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine , Arab , Norman , Spanish and Bourbon conquests of the region .   The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe , bringing a renewed interest in humanism , science , exploration and art . Italian culture flourished at this time , producing famous scholars , artists and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci , Galileo , Michelangelo and Machiavelli . Italian explorers such as Marco Polo , Christopher Columbus , Amerigo Vespucci and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World , helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery . Nevertheless , Italy 's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of the Atlantic trade route and the route to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope , which bypassed the Mediterranean . Furthermore , the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare , culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries that left them exhausted , with no one emerging as a dominant power . The weakened sovereigns soon fell victim to conquest by European powers such as France , Spain and Austria .   By the mid-19th century , a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento , which sought the formation of a unified nation-state . After various unsuccessful attempts , the Italian Wars of Independence and the Expedition of the Thousand resulted in the eventual unification of the country in 1861 , now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division . From the late 19th century to the early 20th century , the new Kingdom of Italy rapidly industrialised , although mainly in the north , and acquired a colonial empire , while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation , fuelling a large and influential diaspora . Despite being one of the main victors in World War I , Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil , leading the way to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922 . The subsequent participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat , economic destruction and an Italian civil war . Following the liberation of Italy and the rise of the resistance , the country abolished the monarchy , reinstated democracy , enjoyed a prolonged economic boom and , despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil -LRB- e.g. Anni di piombo , Mani pulite , the Second Mafia War , the Maxi Trial and subsequent assassinations of anti-mafia officials -RRB- , became a major developed country .   Today , Italy has the third largest economy in the Eurozone and the eighth largest in the world . It has a very high level of human development and is ranked sixth in the world for life expectancy . The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic , military , cultural and diplomatic affairs , and it is both a regional power and a great power . Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the member of numerous international institutions , including the UN , NATO , the OECD , the OSCE , the WTO , the G7/G8 , G20 , the Union for the Mediterranean , the Council of Europe , Uniting for Consensus and many more . As a reflection of its cultural wealth , Italy is home to 51 World Heritage Sites , the most in the world , and is the fifth most visited country . ",REFUTES,"1.

Java contains more than half of the population of Indonesia.,"
The assumption of the claim is that Java, a province in Indonesia, has a population of more than 50%. Therefore, there are three assumptions made when producing the claim: 

1. Java is considered a province and has a population. 
2. Java's population is more than 50%. 
3. The statement ""Java contains more than half of the population of Indonesia"" is true.

Note that the assumption that Java is a province and has a population is a factual statement, while the other two assumptions are based on the claim made.","Indonesia -LRB- -LSB- …™nd…ôÀàniÀê í…ô -RSB- or -LSB- Àå…™ndo äÀàniÀêzi…ô -RSB- ; Indonesian : -LSB- …™ndonesia -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Republic of Indonesia -LRB- -LSB- r…õpublik …™ndonesia -RSB- -RRB- , is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania .

Agriculture mainly produces rice , palm oil , tea , coffee , cacao , medicinal plants , spices and rubber . Indonesia 's major trading partners are Japan , United States , China and the surrounding countries of Singapore , Malaysia and Australia .

Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural , religious and political models from the early centuries CE , and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now-dominant Islam , while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from Amboina and Batavia , and eventually all of the archipelago including Timor and Western New Guinea , at times interrupted by Portuguese , French and British rule , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II .   Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups , with the largest -- and politically dominant -- ethnic group being the Javanese . The population is unevenly spread throughout the islands within a variety of habitats and levels of development , ranging from the megalopolis of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in the east . A shared identity has developed , defined by a national language , ethnic diversity , religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka Tunggal Ika '' -LRB- `` Unity in Diversity '' literally , `` many , yet one '' -RRB- , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's economy is the world 's 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP , the largest in Southeast Asia , and is considered an emerging market and newly industrialised country . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 . Indonesia was an organizer of the Bandung Conference and was the founder of Non-Aligned Movement ; and also the founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , East Asia Summit , and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .

Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War , and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the Soviet Union . He was a member of the Democratic Party who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate prior to becoming president .   Kennedy was born in Brookline , Massachusetts to Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. and Rose Kennedy . A scion of the Kennedy family , he graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the United States Naval Reserve the following year . During World War II , Kennedy commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service . After the war , Kennedy represented Massachusetts 's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 until 1953 . He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960 . While serving in the Senate , he published Profiles in Courage , which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography . In the 1960 presidential election , Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon , who was the incumbent Vice President .   Kennedy 's time in office was marked by high tensions with Communist states in the Cold War . He increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam by a factor of 18 over President Dwight D. Eisenhower . In April 1961 , he authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion . He subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba . In October 1962 , U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba ; the resulting period of tensions , termed the Cuban Missile Crisis , nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict .

Kennedy continues to rank highly in historians ' polls of U.S. presidents and with the general public . His average approval rating of 70 % is the highest of any president in Gallup 's history of systematically measuring job approval .   On November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas . Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the crime , but he was never prosecuted due to his murder by Jack Ruby two days later . Pursuant to the Presidential Succession Act , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president later that day . The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin , but various groups believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy .

What evidence exists to support each of these assumptions when producing the claim that ""John McCain was a presidential nominee in 2008""?</s> 
1. John McCain has been a public figure and politician for decades, with many media appearances and public speeches. His biography and career are well-documented, including his service in the military, as a senator, and as a presidential candidate.

2. The US has presidential elections every four years, with the exception of 2004 when George W. Bush ran unopposed. In every other year, the election takes place on the first Tuesday in November.

7. John McCain lost the popular vote to Barack Obama, receiving 45.7 million votes to Obama's 69.5 million. 

8. John McCain did not receive enough Electoral College votes to become President of the United States.

His second candidacy for the Presidency of the United States , he had previously ran for his party 's nomination in the 2000 primaries and was considered as a potential running mate for his party 's nominee , then-Governor George W. Bush of Texas . After winning a majority of delegates in the Republican primaries of 2008 , on August 29 , leading up to the convention , McCain selected Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate for Vice President . Five days later , at the 2008 Republican National Convention , McCain was formally selected as the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 2008 presidential election .   McCain began the campaign as the apparent frontrunner among Republicans , with a strategy of appearing as the establishment , inevitable candidate ; his campaign website featured an Associated Press article describing him as '' -LSB- a -RSB- political celebrity '' . He made substantial overtures towards elements of the Republican base that had resisted his 2000 insurgency campaign . However , he soon fell behind in polls and fundraising ; by July 2007 his campaign was forced to restructure its size and operations . The tide of Republican sentiment against immigration reform legislation he sponsored also led to the erosion of his lead .   Towards the end of 2007 , McCain began a resurgence , which was capped by his January 2008 wins in the New Hampshire , South Carolina , and Florida primaries . This made him the front-runner for the Republican nomination . On Super Tuesday , McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Republican primaries , giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination . McCain clinched a majority of the delegates and became the presumptive Republican nominee with wins in several more primaries on March 4 . The following day , President George W. Bush endorsed McCain at the White House .   In the general election , facing Democratic nominee , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , McCain was trailing during most of the season , only gaining a lead in national polls for a period after the Palin announcement and the 2008 Republican National Convention . The dominant issue of the campaign became the financial crisis of 2008 . Unable to gain traction against Obama in presidential debates , the final stages of the campaign saw McCain criticizing Obama for being a `` redistributionist '' and adopting symbols such as Joe the Plumber .   On November 4 , 2008 , McCain lost to Barack Obama in the general election , receiving 173 votes of the electoral college to Obama 's 365 and gaining 46 percent of the popular vote to Obama 's 53 percent . Had McCain been elected , he would have been the oldest President to take office at age 72 , succeeding Ronald Reagan , who did so at age 69 , and the first not born in the 50 states , as he was born in the Panama Canal Zone -LRB- a U.S. Territory at the time of McCain 's birth -RRB- .

He was the Republican nominee for the 2008 U.S. presidential election .   McCain followed his father and grandfather , both four-star admirals , into the United States Navy , graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 . He became a naval aviator , flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers . During the Vietnam War , he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire . In October 1967 , while on a bombing mission over Hanoi , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese . He was a prisoner of war until 1973 . McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds have left him with lifelong physical limitations .   He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , McCain served two terms . He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re-election easily five times , most recently in 2016 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a `` maverick '' for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , eventually gaining passage of the McCain -- Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam , and for his belief that the Iraq War should have been fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi-partisan group known as the Gang of 14 .   McCain ran for the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but was defeated by Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 -- 173 electoral college margin and by 53 -- 46 % in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

John McEnroe is famous for his aggressive behavior on the court.,"(1) The concept of fame and the definition of famous varies depending on cultural, societal, and geographical factors. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a precise definition that covers all possible contexts.
    2. The word 'famous' may have different levels of significance for individuals and communities. It is subject to personal opinion and societal interpretation.
    3. The criteria for determining someone's fame vary depending on the perspective of the individual or community. For example, someone may be famous for a specific skill or achievement in a field, while remaining largely unknown in others.
    4. John McEnroe's behavior may have been considered normal in the context of tennis, while it may have been perceived as aggressive and inappropriate in other contexts.
    5. The claim assumes that the person's behavior and fame are related in a causal relationship, i.e., John McEnroe's behavior led to his fame.
    6. The claim also assumes that the concept of fame is static and does not change over time. However, this is not true since people's understanding of fame may change over time, and what is considered famous today may not have been considered so in the past or the future.
    7. The claim does not consider any external factors such as media coverage, political events, or other people or events that may have contributed to John McEnroe's fame.
    8. The claim does not consider the subjective perception of the person making the claim and may not be valid for all individuals or communities.</s> 
How might these assumptions be revised or updated to accurately reflect the current cultural or societal context?</s> 
As a language model, I cannot provide opinions about what should be revised or updated. However, it is important to acknowledge that these assumptions are based on cultural, societal, and geographical factors that may have changed over time and need to be reconsidered. For example, the concept of fame may have become more inclusive and diverse in the current cultural context, and the criteria for determining someone's fame may have expanded to include a broader range of factors such as social media following, political activism, and contributions to social justice movements. Additionally, the claim may need to recognize that John McEnroe's behavior was not appropriate at the time and may no longer be tolerated in the current cultural context.","John Patrick McEnroe Jr. -LRB- born February 16 , 1959 -RRB- is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player , often rated among the greatest players of all time in the sport , especially for his touch on the volley .

How would a historian go about testing and verifying these assumptions based on historical records?</s> 
A historian would start by looking for documentation, such as newspapers, books, and official reports of the Soviet Union during the period of Stalin's leadership. They would look for evidence of Stalin's involvement in the Soviet Union's government, such as reports of his attendance at meetings or his speeches. They would also search for records of the Soviet Union's involvement in events or situations that are mentioned in the claim. This could involve consulting sources such as archives, newspapers, and memoirs of individuals who were involved in the Soviet Union at the time. Once the historian has collected this information, they can analyze it to see if it supports or refutes the assumption. If additional evidence is needed to verify some or all of the assumptions, the historian can continue to research further and look for additional sources.","Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin -LRB- -LSB- Ààst…ëÀêl…™n -RSB- 18 December 1878 -- 5 March 1953 -RRB- was a Soviet revolutionary , politician and political theorist . He governed the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 . In this capacity , he served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953 and as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 . Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist , he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism-Leninism while his own policies and theories became known as Stalinism .   Stalin was born to a poor Georgian family in Gori , Russian Empire . After an education at Tiflis Spiritual Seminary , he joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Affiliated with Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction , he raised funds via underground activities such as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery . After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and established a one-party state , Stalin sat on the Politburo during the Russian Civil War . In 1922 Stalin became General Secretary and established the Soviet Union . Despite Lenin 's objection , power consolidated around Stalin and opposition removed following Lenin 's death in 1924 . During Stalin 's tenure the concept of `` Socialism in One Country '' became a central tenet of Soviet society , and a cult of personality developed around Stalin . Lenin 's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy , industrialisation and collectivisation . These rapidly transformed the country from an agrarian society into an industrial power , but disrupted food production and contributed to the famine of 1933 -- 34 . Between 1934 and 1939 , Stalin organised the `` Great Purge '' , in which millions of so-called `` enemies of the working class '' , including senior political and military figures , were interned in Gulag-run prisons , exiled or executed , often without due process .   In August 1939 Stalin entered a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany , resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year . Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941 . Despite initial setbacks , the Soviet Red Army halted the German incursion and captured Berlin in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and backed the establishment of pro-Soviet Marxist governments both throughout Eastern Europe and in China , North Korea , and North Vietnam . The Soviet Union and United States emerged as the two world superpowers , and a period of tensions began between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc known as the Cold War . Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase , during which it became the second country to develop a nuclear weapon , as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another major famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism . Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who denounced Stalin and initiated a de-Stalinisation process .   Stalin is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century . Stalinism influenced various Marxist-Leninist groups and governments across the world , for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class . After the fall of the Soviet Union , Stalin has been praised by supporters for his role in defeating Nazi Germany and establishing the Soviet Union as a major world power . Critics emphasise his role in causing millions of deaths and numerous political , religious and ethnic repressions . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

8. Stalin was not a fictional character or a composite of several individuals.","Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin -LRB- -LSB- Ààst…ëÀêl…™n -RSB- 18 December 1878 -- 5 March 1953 -RRB- was a Soviet revolutionary , politician and political theorist . He governed the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 . In this capacity , he served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953 and as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 . Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist , he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism-Leninism while his own policies and theories became known as Stalinism .   Stalin was born to a poor Georgian family in Gori , Russian Empire . After an education at Tiflis Spiritual Seminary , he joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Affiliated with Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction , he raised funds via underground activities such as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery . After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and established a one-party state , Stalin sat on the Politburo during the Russian Civil War . In 1922 Stalin became General Secretary and established the Soviet Union . Despite Lenin 's objection , power consolidated around Stalin and opposition removed following Lenin 's death in 1924 . During Stalin 's tenure the concept of `` Socialism in One Country '' became a central tenet of Soviet society , and a cult of personality developed around Stalin . Lenin 's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy , industrialisation and collectivisation . These rapidly transformed the country from an agrarian society into an industrial power , but disrupted food production and contributed to the famine of 1933 -- 34 . Between 1934 and 1939 , Stalin organised the `` Great Purge '' , in which millions of so-called `` enemies of the working class '' , including senior political and military figures , were interned in Gulag-run prisons , exiled or executed , often without due process .   In August 1939 Stalin entered a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany , resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year . Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941 . Despite initial setbacks , the Soviet Red Army halted the German incursion and captured Berlin in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and backed the establishment of pro-Soviet Marxist governments both throughout Eastern Europe and in China , North Korea , and North Vietnam . The Soviet Union and United States emerged as the two world superpowers , and a period of tensions began between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc known as the Cold War . Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase , during which it became the second country to develop a nuclear weapon , as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another major famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism . Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who denounced Stalin and initiated a de-Stalinisation process .   Stalin is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century . Stalinism influenced various Marxist-Leninist groups and governments across the world , for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class . After the fall of the Soviet Union , Stalin has been praised by supporters for his role in defeating Nazi Germany and establishing the Soviet Union as a major world power . Critics emphasise his role in causing millions of deaths and numerous political , religious and ethnic repressions . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Ketogenic diet has protein.,"
1. All ketogenic diets contain protein.
2. The protein content in ketogenic diets is enough to satisfy the body's requirements for protein.
3. The protein content in ketogenic diets is of high quality, meaning that it contains all the essential amino acids in the recommended amounts.
4. Ketogenic diets are designed to promote fat loss, not muscle loss. Therefore, the protein content of ketogenic diets is sufficient to preserve muscle mass while promoting fat loss.
5. Ketogenic diets do not compromise the digestive system, making the protein intake and absorption consistent.
6. There is no evidence to suggest that protein intake from ketogenic diets has any negative impact on other bodily functions and health.
7. There is sufficient research and clinical data to support the claim that ketogenic diets provide adequate protein to individuals.
8. Ketogenic diets are designed to help individuals lose weight, and protein is a crucial component of weight loss, making it a crucial component of ketogenic diets.","The ketogenic diet is a high-fat , adequate-protein , low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control -LRB- refractory -RRB- epilepsy in children . The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates . Normally , the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose , which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function . However , if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet , the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies . The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source . An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood , a state known as ketosis , leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures . Almost half of children , and young people , with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half , and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet . There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet , and that a less strict regimen , such as a modified Atkins diet , is similarly effective . The most common adverse effect is constipation , affecting about 30 % of patients -- this was due to fluid restriction , which was once a feature of the diet , but this led to increased risk of kidney stones , and is no longer considered beneficial .   The original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair , and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height . The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade , but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant drugs . This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate . This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables , bread , pasta , grains and sugar , while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts , cream and butter . Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides -LRB- LCTs -RRB- . However , medium-chain triglycerides -LRB- MCTs -RRB- -- made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs -- are more ketogenic . A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil , which is rich in MCTs , to provide around half the calories . As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet , a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed , allowing a greater variety of food choices .   In the mid-1990s , Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams , whose son 's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet , created the Charlie Foundation to promote it . Publicity included an appearance on NBC 's Dateline programme and ... First Do No Harm -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep . The foundation sponsored a multicentre research study , the results of which -- announced in 1996 -- marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet .   Clinical trials and studies in animal models -LRB- including C. elegans -RRB- suggest that ketogenic diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits for a number of adult neurodegenerative disorders . As of 2012 , there is limited clinical trial data in these areas , and , outside of paediatric epilepsy , use of the ketogenic diet remains at the research stage . ",SUPPORTS,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO

Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War , and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the Soviet Union . He was a member of the Democratic Party who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate prior to becoming president .   Kennedy was born in Brookline , Massachusetts to Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. and Rose Kennedy . A scion of the Kennedy family , he graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the United States Naval Reserve the following year .

Lisbon has a population larger than 1.,"
Here are 3 possible assumptions made when producing the claim:
1. People who were not born or who are not currently living in Lisbon but who may have lived there in the past are not included in the population count.
2. There is a precise method for counting the population of a city, and this was used to make the claim.
3. The population of Lisbon may have fluctuated in the past, but at the time of the claim there was enough evidence to suggest the population was larger than 1.

Note: these are just examples and may not be completely accurate to the claim.","Lisbon -LRB- -LSB- Ààl…™zb…ôn -RSB- Lisboa , -LSB- li íÀàŒ≤o…ê -RSB- -RRB- is the capital and the largest city of Portugal , with a population of 552,700 within its administrative limits in an area of 100.05 km ¬≤ .

  - 6. Hiroshima is the name of the city where the bomb was dropped.
  - 7. The bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945.","`` Little Boy '' was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay , piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces . It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare . The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test , and the first uranium-based detonation . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 ktonTNT . The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima and its occupants .   Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group of Captain William S. Parsons 's Ordnance -LRB- O -RRB- Division at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II . Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer . The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun-type fission weapon , but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235 . This was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium -LRB- the `` bullet '' -RRB- onto a solid cylinder of the same material -LRB- the `` target '' -RRB- by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg of enriched uranium , of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design .   After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed , but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base . The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft -LRB- which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers -RRB- . All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951 . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

   - The constant cycles of life and death
   - The value of bravery, courage, and determination
   - The importance of family and loyalty
   - The influence of fate and the role of human agency in shaping one's destiny
   - The dangers of pride and hubris.","In Norse mythology , Loki -LRB- Anglicized -LRB- -LSB- Ààlo äki -RSB- -RRB- -RRB- , Loptr , or Hve√∞rungr is a god or j√∂tunn -LRB- or both -RRB- . Loki is the son of F√°rbauti and Laufey , and the brother of Helblindi and B√Ωleistr . By the j√∂tunn Angrbo√∞a , Loki is the father of Hel , the wolf Fenrir , and the world serpent J√∂rmungandr . By his wife Sigyn , Loki is the father of Narfi and/or Nari . By the stallion Sva√∞ilfari , Loki is the mother -- giving birth in the form of a mare -- to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir . In addition , Loki is referred to as the father of V√°li in Prose Edda , though this source also refers to Odin as the father of V√°li twice , and V√°li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once .   Loki 's relation with the gods varies by source ; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them . Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a salmon , a mare , a fly , and possibly an elderly woman named √û√∂kk -LRB- Old Norse ` thanks ' -RRB- . Loki 's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr and Loki is eventually bound by V√°li with the entrails of one of his sons . In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda , the goddess Ska√∞i is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound . The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl ; however , she must empty the bowl when it is full , and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain , thereby causing earthquakes . With the onset of Ragnar√∂k , Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the j√∂tnar , at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr and the two will slay each other .   Loki is referred to in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; the Norwegian Rune Poems , in the poetry of skalds , and in Scandinavian folklore . Loki may be depicted on the Snaptun Stone , the Kirkby Stephen Stone , and the Gosforth Cross . Loki 's origins and role in Norse mythology , which some scholars have described as that of a trickster god , have been much debated by scholars . Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture . ",SUPPORTS,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO

Marc Maron was the host of a show.,"- Marc Maron is a comedian.
    - Marc Maron was born on September 27, 1963.
    - Marc Maron has been in the entertainment industry since at least 1989.
    - Marc Maron has been the host of ""WTF"" from 2009 to the present date.
    - Marc Maron has hosted a variety of other shows and projects throughout his career.
    - Marc Maron has interviewed many celebrities and industry leaders over the years.
    - Marc Maron has been recognized with various awards and accolades for his work.

2. Identify the potential biases, blind spots, and limitations of this claim and the assumptions underlying it.
    The assumption that Marc Maron has been the host of ""WTF"" from 2009 to the present date may not be accurate. It is possible that there have been periods in which he has taken breaks or had other commitments that have prevented him from hosting the show. Additionally, the assumption that he has interviewed many celebrities and industry leaders ignores the fact that he may have a particular political or ideological bias that affects the types of people he chooses to interview. Furthermore, the assumption that Marc Maron has been recognized with various awards and accolades may overlook certain biases or preferences in the industry that have contributed to his success. Finally, the assumption that he has been in the entertainment industry since at least 1989 could be biased towards the idea that success in the industry is only possible if a person starts relatively early in their career, and may overlook the possibility that someone could have a later breakthrough or career change.","Marcus David Maron -LRB- -LSB- Ààm√¶r…ôn -RSB- ; born September 27 , 1963 -RRB- is an American stand-up comedian , podcaster , writer , actor , musician , director , and producer .

</ol>","Marilyn Monroe -LRB- born Norma Jeane Mortenson ; June 1 , 1926 -- August 5 , 1962 -RRB- was an American actress and model . Famous for playing comic `` dumb blonde '' characters , she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s , emblematic of the era 's attitudes towards sexuality . Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade , her films grossed $ 200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962 . She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon .   Born and raised in Los Angeles , Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen . While working in a factory in 1944 as part of the war effort , she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career . The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox -LRB- 1946 -- 1947 -RRB- and Columbia Pictures -LRB- 1948 -RRB- . After a series of minor film roles , she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951 . Over the next two years , she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies , including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business , and in the dramas Clash by Night and Do n't Bother to Knock . Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star , but rather than damaging her career , the story resulted in increased interest in her films .   By 1953 , Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars , with leading roles in three films : the noir Niagara , which focused on her sex appeal , and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire , which established her star image as a `` dumb blonde '' . Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career , she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio . She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project , but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career , The Seven Year Itch -LRB- 1955 -RRB- .   When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract , Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954 ; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions -LRB- MMP -RRB- . She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio . In late 1955 , Fox awarded her a new contract , which gave her more control and a larger salary . After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop -LRB- 1956 -RRB- and acting in the first independent production of MMP , The Prince and the Showgirl -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot -LRB- 1959 -RRB- . Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits -LRB- 1961 -RRB- .   Monroe 's troubled private life received much attention . She struggled with substance abuse , depression , and anxiety . She had two highly publicized marriages , to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller , both of which ended in divorce . On August 5 , 1962 , she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles . Although Monroe 's death was ruled a probable suicide , several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

Great work! Your list of assumptions is very thorough. Do you think there are any potential flaws or limitations in your assumptions? If so, how might they change the overall claim's validity?</s> 
As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to make assumptions, but I can say that any flaw or limitation in the assumptions may affect the validity of the final claim.

Marlon Brando took part in a film adapted from the work of a writer of more than 40 books.,"[1] Marlon Brando is a well-known actor who has been in many movies, so it is likely that he took part in at least one movie that was adapted from a book.
    [2] The writer of the book must have written more than 40 books, as the claim states, since the number of books written by an author does not change unless the author writes more books in the future.
    [3] The claim does not specify which book(s) by the author were adapted into a movie, or if Marlon Brando played a role in any of those movies, so those details cannot be assumed.
    [4] If the author is known to be deceased, it is unlikely that the book(s) in question were adapted for a movie while the writer was still alive.
    [5] If the book in question was written before 1950 or so, it is unlikely that Marlon Brando was in the film adaptation, since he did not become a well-known actor until the mid-1940s.
    [6] If the film adaptation of the book did not feature Marlon Brando or any other well-known actors, it is unlikely that it was a popular or successful movie.
    [7] If the movie was popular and successful despite not featuring any well-known actors, it might have been directed or produced by someone who went on to become famous or influential in the film industry.
    [8] If the film adaptation of the book was produced during Marlon Brando's later career, it is possible that he took a supporting role or had a cameo rather than a leading role.

Mauritius has high political freedom.,"
Here are a number of assumptions made when producing the claim that Mauritius has high political freedom:

1. The definition of political freedom was not provided, so we assume that it means Mauritius has a high degree of freedom from state control and interference.
2. The source of the claim did not provide specific metrics or data to measure Mauritius' political freedom, so we assume that it is based on subjective evaluations from various sources.
3. The claim does not specify whether Mauritius' political freedom can be traced to its colonial history or to its current governance, so we assume that it is an aggregate measure of political freedoms across different eras.
4. The claim does not specify which specific freedoms are included in the measurement of political freedom, so we assume that it encompasses a broad range of civil, political, and social rights.
5. The claim does not provide a comparative analysis to assess the magnitude of Mauritius' political freedoms compared to other countries, so we assume that it is meant to highlight the country's unique strengths in the realm of political freedoms.
6. The claim does not account for the impact of Mauritius' political culture, historical context, or economic development on its levels of political freedom, so we assume that it is meant to provide a broad overview of the country's current state of affairs.
7. The claim does not acknowledge the potential for political freedom to conflict with other societal values or to be subject to external pressures, so we assume that it is meant to celebrate Mauritius' achievements in this area.
8. The claim may not reflect the perspectives of all Mauritius residents, so we assume that it may be subject to bias and should be interpreted with caution.","Mauritius -LRB- -LSB- m…ôÀàr…™ É…ôs -RSB- or -LSB- m…ôÀàr…™ ÉiÀê…ôs -RSB- Maurice -RRB- , officially the Republic of Mauritius -LRB- R√©publique de Maurice -RRB- , is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km off the southeast coast of the African continent .

Melisandre was left out of A Storm of Swords (2000).," 1. The books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series are written in a linear timeline, in which each book follows events chronologically from the previous book.
     2. Melisandre is a major character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, and her role in the story is significant enough that her absence would stand out to readers.

Born approximately 570CE -LRB- Year of the Elephant -RRB- in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at an early age ; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib . Periodically , he would seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer ; later , at age 40 , he reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , where he stated he received his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that `` God is One '' , that complete `` surrender '' -LRB- lit . islƒÅm -RRB- to him is the right course of action -LRB- dƒ´n -RRB- , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam .   Muhammad gained few early followers , and met hostility from some Meccan tribes . To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina -LRB- then known as Yathrib -RRB- in the year 622 . This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , also known as the Hijri Calendar . In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina . In December 629 , after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes , Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca . The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed . In 632 , a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage , he fell ill and died . Before his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam .   The revelations -LRB- each known as Ayah , lit . `` Sign -LSB- of God -RSB- '' -RRB- , which Muhammad reported receiving until his death , form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the religion is based .

    (3) The claim assumes that the Temptations are the sole authors and creators of the song.
    (4) The claim assumes that there are no other versions or covers of the song with a different title that could be attributed to any other artists.
    (5) The claim assumes that the song was not written or co-written by anyone who is not a member of the Temptations.

    (8) The claim may also assume that the song 'My Sweet Lord' is widely recognized as a work of The Temptations and is not attributed to anyone else.","`` My Sweet Lord '' is a song by English musician and former Beatle , George Harrison . It was released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass . Also issued as a single , Harrison 's first as a solo artist , `` My Sweet Lord '' topped charts worldwide and was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK . In America and Britain , the song was the first number one single by an ex-Beatle . Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 .   Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's much-admired slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as being `` musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro '' . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording .   Later in the 1970s , `` My Sweet Lord '' was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit , due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song `` He 's So Fine '' , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright `` Oh Happy Day '' , a Christian hymn , as his inspiration for the song 's melody .   Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked the song as `` My Sweet Lord -LRB- 2000 -RRB- '' for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass . Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams , Peggy Lee , Edwin Starr , Johnny Mathis , Nina Simone , Julio Iglesias , Richie Havens , Megadeth , Boy George , Elton John , Jim James , Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith . `` My Sweet Lord '' is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of `` the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002 , two months after Harrison 's death .

As Napoleon I , he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 , and again in 1815 . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . One of the greatest commanders in history , his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon 's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history .   He was born Napoleone di Buonaparte -LRB- -LSB- napoleo≈ãe dj bu…î≈ãaparte -RSB- -RRB- in Corsica , Republic of Genoa , to a relatively modest family from the minor nobility . When the Revolution broke out in 1789 , Napoleon was serving as an artillery officer in the French army . Seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution , he rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , becoming a general at age 24 . The Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed a revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies -- winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year , and becoming a national hero . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power . He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic . His ambition and public approval inspired him to go further , and in 1804 he became the first Emperor of the French '' . Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805 . Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph over Russia and Austria at the Battle of Austerlitz , which led to the elimination of the thousand year-old Holy Roman Empire . In 1806 , the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent . Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt , then marched the Grand Army deep into Eastern Europe and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the Battle of Friedland . France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the Treaties of Tilsit in July 1807 , bringing an uneasy peace to the continent . Tilsit signified the high watermark of the French Empire . In 1809 , the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition , but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram in July .   Hoping to extend the Continental System and choke off British trade with the European mainland , Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808 . The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support . The Peninsular War lasted six years , featured extensive guerrilla warfare , and ended in victory for the Allies . The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states , especially Russia . Unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade , the Russians routinely violated the Continental System and enticed Napoleon into another war . The French launched a major invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812 . The resulting campaign witnessed the collapse of the Grand Army , the destruction of Russian cities , and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies . In 1813 , Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France . A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813 . The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814 , forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April . He was exiled to the island of Elba near Rome and the Bourbons were restored to power . However , Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again . The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition , which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June . The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic , where he died six years later at the age of 51 .   Napoleon had an extensive and powerful influence on the modern world , bringing liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled , such as the Low Countries , Switzerland , and large parts of modern Italy and Germany . He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe . His legal achievement , the Napoleonic Code , has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world . British historian Andrew Roberts stated , `` The ideas that underpin our modern world -- meritocracy , equality before the law , property rights , religious toleration , modern secular education , sound finances , and so on -- were championed , consolidated , codified and geographically extended by Napoleon . To them he added a rational and efficient local administration , an end to rural banditry , the encouragement of science and the arts , the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire '' .

7. Assumption: The Allies did not continue to fight Nazi Germany after Hitler's death.
8. Assumption: There were no other Nazi leaders or high-ranking officials who continued to lead Nazi Germany after Hitler's death.","Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945 , when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party -LRB- NSDAP -RRB- . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich from 1933 to 1943 and Gro√üdeutsches Reich -LRB- `` Greater German Reich '' -RRB- from 1943 to 1945 . The period is also known under the names the Third Reich -LRB- Drittes Reich -RRB- and the National Socialist Period -LRB- Zeit des Nationalsozialismus , abbreviated as NS-Zeit -RRB- . The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe .   Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933 . The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 , and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F√ºhrer -LRB- leader -RRB- of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person , and his word became above all laws . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy . Extensive public works were undertaken , including the construction of Autobahnen -LRB- motorways -RRB- . The return to economic stability boosted the regime 's popularity .   Racism , especially antisemitism , was a central feature of the regime . The Germanic peoples -LRB- the Nordic race -RRB- were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race , and were therefore viewed as the master race . Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust . Opposition to Hitler 's rule was ruthlessly suppressed . Members of the liberal , socialist , and communist opposition were killed , imprisoned , or exiled . Christian churches were also oppressed , with many leaders imprisoned . Education focused on racial biology , population policy , and fitness for military service . Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed . Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program , and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage . Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film , mass rallies , and Hitler 's hypnotic oratory to control public opinion . The government controlled artistic expression , promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others .   Beginning in the late 1930s , Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands , threatening war if they were not met . It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939 . Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939 , launching World War II in Europe . In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers , Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain . Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas , and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland . Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned , murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps , or shot .   Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 , the tide gradually turned against the Nazis , who suffered major military defeats in 1943 . Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 , and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe . Following the Allied invasion of France , Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year . Hitler 's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war . The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials . ",REFUTES,"1. NOT ENOUGH INFO

Nelson Mandela was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.,"- Nelson Mandela was born and lived in South Africa
    - Nelson Mandela was involved in the struggle for racial equality in South Africa
    - Nelson Mandela was a leader of the African National Congress (ANC) and was imprisoned for his activism
    - Nelson Mandela emerged from prison as a symbol of the fight against apartheid
    - Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990 and negotiated a peaceful transition to democracy with the apartheid government
    - Nelson Mandela was elected as the first President of post-apartheid South Africa in 1994
    - Nelson Mandela served as President of South Africa until 1999, leading the nation through its transition to democracy and building strong international relationships

This claim can be inferred from a variety of sources including historical documents, biographies, and news reports. Additionally, the assumption that Nelson Mandela was born and lived in South Africa is based on his personal history and identity as a South African citizen.","Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela -LRB- -LSB- m√¶nÀàd…õl…ô -RSB- 18 July 1918 -- 5 December 2013 -RRB- was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary , politician , and philanthropist , who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 . He was the country 's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election . His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation . Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist , he served as President of the African National Congress -LRB- ANC -RRB- party from 1991 to 1997 .   A Xhosa , Mandela was born in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family . He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg . There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics , joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944 . After the National Party 's white-only government established apartheid -- a system of racial segregation that privileged whites -- he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow . Mandela was appointed President of the ANC 's Transvaal branch , rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People . He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial . Influenced by Marxism , he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party -LRB- SACP -RRB- . Although initially committed to non-violent protest , in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government . In 1962 , he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial .   Mandela served 27 years in prison , initially on Robben Island , and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison . Amid growing domestic and international pressure , and with fears of a racial civil war , President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 . Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President . Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution , Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country 's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses . Economically , Mandela 's administration retained its predecessor 's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs , also introducing measures to encourage land reform , combat poverty , and expand healthcare services . Internationally , he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999 . He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy , Thabo Mbeki . Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation .   Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life . Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid 's supporters , he gained international acclaim for his activism . Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice , he received more than 250 honours -- including the Nobel Peace Prize -- and became the subject of a cult of personality . He is held in deep respect within South Africa , where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name , Madiba , and described as the `` Father of the Nation '' . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

Noam Chomsky is only a historian.,"(1) Noam Chomsky is a linguist who is well-known for his contributions to generative grammar.
    (2) Generative grammar is a framework for understanding the principles that govern human language acquisition and usage.
    (3) Therefore, Noam Chomsky is an expert in linguistics and not history.
    (4) Historians study the past and analyze the causes of historical events.
    (5) Linguists, on the other hand, study language in isolation from the historical context of its use.
    (6) Noam Chomsky is well-respected in linguistics and has published many papers and books on the topic of language, but he is not a historian.
    (7) Therefore, his expertise does not cover the field of history.
    (8) The conclusion of the claim is that Noam Chomsky is not a historian.","Avram Noam Chomsky -LRB- -LSB- √¶ ` vr…ëÀêm _ ` no äm_Ààt É…ímski -RSB- ; born December 7 , 1928 -RRB- is an American linguist , philosopher , cognitive scientist , historian , social critic , and political activist . Sometimes described as `` the father of modern linguistics '' , Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science . He is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -LRB- MIT -RRB- , where he has worked since 1955 , and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism .   Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . At the age of sixteen he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania , taking courses in linguistics , mathematics , and philosophy . From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University 's Society of Fellows , where he developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which remodeled the scientific study of language , while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism , being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner .   An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay `` The Responsibility of Intellectuals '' . Associated with the New Left , he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon 's Enemies List . While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades , he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars . In collaboration with Edward S. Herman , Chomsky later co-wrote an analysis articulating the propaganda model of media criticism , and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor . However , his defense of unconditional freedom of speech -- including for Holocaust deniers -- generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s . Following his retirement from active teaching , he has continued his vocal political activism , including opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy movement .   One of the most cited scholars in history , Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields . He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences , contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind . In addition to his continued scholarly research , he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy , neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism , the Israeli -- Palestinian conflict , and mainstream news media . His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements , but have also drawn criticism , with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism . ",REFUTES,"1.

None of lung cancer's symptoms is chest pains.,"
1. Lung cancer may or may not have symptoms at all. 
2. Lung cancer's symptoms vary from person to person, so it is impossible to say which symptom will always or never appear. 
3. Chest pains can be caused by a variety of medical conditions, so it is possible that someone with lung cancer may also experience chest pains, even if it is not a common symptom associated with the disease. 
4. The claim assumes that a diagnosis of lung cancer means that the individual had none of the symptoms associated with the disease, even though they may have experienced other symptoms or have had a previous medical history of the disease without symptoms. 
5. The claim also assumes that chest pain is a reliable indicator of lung cancer, when in fact it can be caused by other medical conditions or lifestyle habits. 
6. The claim does not take into account the possibility of false negatives or other diagnostic tests that may not accurately detect lung cancer or its symptoms. 
7. The claim does not take into account any potential changes in medical research or treatment options that may affect the symptoms associated with lung cancer. 
8. The claim assumes that there is a single, universal definition of lung cancer and its associated symptoms that applies to all patients, which may not be the case.","Lung cancer , also known as lung carcinoma , is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung . This growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body . Most cancers that start in the lung , known as primary lung cancers , are carcinomas . The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma -LRB- SCLC -RRB- and non-small-cell lung carcinoma -LRB- NSCLC -RRB- . The most common symptoms are coughing -LRB- including coughing up blood -RRB- , weight loss , shortness of breath , and chest pains .   The vast majority -LRB- 85 % -RRB- of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking . About 10 -- 15 % of cases occur in people who have never smoked . These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas , asbestos , second-hand smoke , or other forms of air pollution . Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography -LRB- CT -RRB- scans . The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance .   Avoidance of risk factors , including smoking and air pollution , is the primary method of prevention . Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer , the stage -LRB- degree of spread -RRB- , and the person 's overall health . Most cases are not curable . Common treatments include surgery , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy . NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery , whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .   Worldwide in 2012 , lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths . This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer . The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years . Overall , 17.4 % of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis , while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

8. The claim is not meant to imply that the death of Edgar Allan Poe was the most significant event of October, or of the 19th century.","Edgar Allan Poe -LRB- -LSB- po ä -RSB- born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 -- October 7 , 1849 -RRB- was an American writer , editor , and literary critic . Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories , particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre . He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole , and he was one of the country 's earliest practitioners of the short story . Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction . He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career .   Poe was born in Boston , the second child of two actors . His father abandoned the family in 1810 , and his mother died the following year . Thus orphaned , the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond , Virginia . They never formally adopted him , but Poe was with them well into young adulthood . Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts , including those incurred by gambling , and the cost of secondary education for the young man . Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money . Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name . It was at this time that his publishing career began , albeit humbly , with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems -LRB- 1827 -RRB- , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' . With the death of Frances Allan in 1829 , Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement . However , Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point , declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer , and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan .   Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism . His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City . In Richmond in 1836 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin . In January 1845 , Poe published his poem `` The Raven '' to instant success . His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication . For years , he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn -LRB- later renamed The Stylus -RRB- , though he died before it could be produced . Poe died in Baltimore on October 7 , 1849 , at age 40 ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease , rabies , suicide , tuberculosis , and other agents .   Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world , as well as in specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography . Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature , music , films , and television . A number of his homes are dedicated museums today . The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

Overwatch is a board game.,"
1. Board games are defined as physical games that players interact with on a surface that has designated spaces and markings.

"Overwatch is a video game in which players gain cosmetic awards and it assigns players into two teams of six, each player with a style of play known as Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support.","- Overwatch players gain cosmetic awards as incentives and rewards.
    - Overwatch players are divided into two teams of 6 players.
    - The style of play in Overwatch is categorized into four types of roles: offense, defense, tank, and support.
    - Each player in the game can choose a specific role to play from a selection of characters with specific abilities and skills.
    - The game allows players to level up their character by completing certain missions and earning achievements.
    - There is a ranked system in the game that allows players to compete against each other and gain ranks based on their performance.
    - Each character has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses that affect the overall strategy and gameplay. 
    - In-game communication, teamwork, and coordination are key factors in successful gameplay.

Assumption 1 could be challenged by someone who disagrees with the idea of cosmetic rewards being an effective motivator for players. Assumption 2 could be challenged by someone who thinks Overwatch should allow a different number of players on each team. Assumption 3 could be challenged by someone who believes that the roles of offense, defense, tank, and support in Overwatch should not be defined as such or are not effective for gameplay. Assumption 4 could be challenged by someone who believes that Overwatch should allow for more customization of character abilities and skills. Assumption 5 could be challenged by someone who thinks that the ranked system does not accurately reflect players' skill levels or should be removed from the game. Assumption 6 could be challenged by someone who believes that each character's abilities should be more balanced or that there are too many overpowered characters in the game. Assumption 7 could be challenged by someone who believes that in-game communication, teamwork, and coordination are not as important in Overwatch as other aspects of gameplay.","Overwatch is a team-based online multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment .

Newman stars in the title role as Luke , a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system .

Paul is Steve Jobs' middle name.,"
  1. There are only two people known to the world named Paul Jobs - Steve Jobs' father and Steve Jobs himself. 
      
     - It is unlikely that a person would choose the name Paul for themselves if their father is the most famous 
          person in the world with that same middle name. 
      
     - Steve Jobs' father's middle name was Paul, and there is a strong likelihood of Steve Jobs having followed in his father's footsteps. 
    2. Steve Jobs' birth name is Steven.
      
     - In order for Steve Jobs to have the middle name Paul, he would have had to legally change his middle name from Paul to Steven. It is unlikely that 
          Jobs would have done this without any significant event in his life that would have required him to change his middle name.
      
     - The likelihood of Jobs legally changing his middle name without any significant event in his life is minimal.
    3. Steve Jobs was a highly successful and influential person in the technology industry.
      
     - It is highly unlikely that someone who has had so much success and influence in their industry would change their middle name for no apparent reason.
      
    4. The claim of Steve Jobs having a middle name Paul originated from an anonymous source and has never been independently verified.
      
    5. Steve Jobs never publicly acknowledged that his middle name was Paul.
      
    6. The claim of Steve Jobs' middle name being Paul first arose after Jobs' death and has not received any significant attention or investigation from mainstream news media.
      
    7. The claim is not mentioned in any major biographies, documentaries or articles related to Steve Jobs' life and career.
      
    8. There is no evidence of Steve Jobs' birth certificate, which could potentially reveal his middle name.
    9. The claim does not appear in any official documents related to Steve Jobs' legal or business dealings.","Steven Paul Jobs -LRB- -LSB- Ààd í…íbz -RSB- February 24 , 1955 -- October 5 , 2011 -RRB- was an American entrepreneur , businessman , inventor , and industrial designer . He was the co-founder , chairman , and chief executive officer -LRB- CEO -RRB- of Apple Inc. ; CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar ; a member of The Walt Disney Company 's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar ; and founder , chairman , and CEO of NeXT . Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s .   Jobs was born in San Francisco to Syrian parents who had to put him up for adoption at birth ; he was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s . Jobs briefly attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out . He then decided to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism . Jobs 's declassified FBI report stated that an acquaintance knew that Jobs had used the illegal drugs marijuana and LSD while he was in college . Jobs once told a reporter that taking LSD was `` one of the two or three most important things '' he did in his life .   Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak 's Apple I personal computer . The visionaries gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II , one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers . In 1979 , after a tour of PARC , Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto , which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface -LRB- GUI -RRB- . This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983 , followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984 . In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI , the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter , the first laser printer to feature vector graphics . Following a long power struggle , Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 .   After leaving Apple , Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT , a computer platform development company specializing in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets . In addition , Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas 's Lucasfilm in 1986 . The new company , Pixar , would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film , Toy Story -- an event made possible in part because of Jobs 's financial support .   In 1997 , Apple merged with NeXT . Within a few months of the merger , Jobs became CEO of his former company , reviving Apple at the verge of bankruptcy . Beginning in 1997 with the `` Think different '' advertising campaign , Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications : the iMac , iTunes and iTunes Store , Apple Store , iPod , iPhone , App Store , and the iPad . Mac OS was also revamped into OS X -LRB- renamed `` macOS '' in 2016 -RRB- , based on NeXT 's NeXTSTEP platform .   Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died on October 5 , 2011 , of respiratory arrest related to the tumor . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

Pluto is not relatively small.,"[1] There is no other planet or dwarf planet larger than Pluto in our solar system.
    [2] Pluto is the smallest planet in our solar system.
    [3] Pluto's size cannot be accurately compared to other planets or dwarf planets without proper context.
    Can you explain why Pluto has been demoted from a planet to a dwarf planet?</s> 
Yes, the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet was largely due to the discovery of other objects in the solar system that are similar in size and composition but are located beyond Neptune. This led to a re-evaluation of the definition of 'planet' and ultimately resulted in the new category of 'dwarf planet.' Additionally, it was found that Pluto's gravitational influence on nearby asteroids was much weaker than other planets, suggesting that it is not significant enough to be classified as a planet.","Pluto -LRB- minor-planet designation : 134340 Pluto -RRB- is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt , a ring of bodies beyond Neptune . It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered .   Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun . After 1992 , its planethood was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt . In 2005 , Eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27 % more massive than Pluto , was discovered . This led the International Astronomical Union -LRB- IAU -RRB- to define the term `` planet '' formally in 2006 , during their 26th General Assembly . That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet .   Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun . It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris . Like other Kuiper belt objects , Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small -- about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume . It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU -LRB- 4.4 -- 7.4 billion km -RRB- from the Sun . This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune , but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding . Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance -LRB- 39.5 AU -RRB- .   Pluto has five known moons : Charon -LRB- the largest , with a diameter just over half that of Pluto -RRB- , Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body .   On July 14 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto . During its brief flyby , New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons . In September 2016 , astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins , organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life , and produced from methane , nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred about 19,000 km to the orbiting moon .

It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe . To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain . The Portugal -- Spain border is 1214 km long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union . The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments .   The territory of modern Portugal has been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The Pre-Celts , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples . Portugal as a country was born in the aftermath of the Christian Reconquista against the Moors who had invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD and occupied most of it ever since . Precipitated by the seminal event for its foundation , the Battle of S√£o Mamede , where Portuguese forces led by Afonso Henriques defeated forces led by his mother Theresa of Portugal and her lover Fern√£o Peres de Trava , which established the nation 's sovereignty against rival neighbor kingdoms . Following S√£o Mamede , the future king styled himself Prince of Portugal . He would be proclaimed King of Portugal in the Battle of Ourique in 1139 and was recognised as such by neighbouring kingdoms in 1143 .   In the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal established the first global empire , becoming one of the world 's major economic , political and military powers . During this time , Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery , notably under royal patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator and King Jo√£o II , with such notable discoveries as Bartolomeu Dias 's reach of the Cape of Good Hope -LRB- 1488 -RRB- , the Vasco da Gama 's sea route to India -LRB- 1497 -- 98 -RRB- and the discovery of Brazil -LRB- 1500 -RRB- . Portugal monopolized the spice trade during this time , and the Portuguese Empire expanded with military campaigns led in Asia . But the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake , the country 's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars , the independence of Brazil -LRB- 1822 -RRB- , and the Liberal Wars -LRB- 1828 -- 34 -RRB- , all left Portugal crippled from war and diminished in its world power .   After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy , the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established , later being superseded by the Estado Novo right-wing authoritarian regime . Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974 . Shortly after , independence was granted to almost all its overseas territories . The handover of Macau to China in 1999 marked the end of the longest-lived colonial empire . Portugal has left a profound cultural and architectural influence across the globe and a legacy of over 250 million Portuguese speakers today .   Portugal is a developed country with a high-income advanced economy and a high living standard . It is the 5th most peaceful country in the world , maintaining a unitary semi-presidential republican form of government . It has the 18th highest Social Progress in the world , putting it ahead of other Western European countries like France , Spain and Italy . A founding member of NATO and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries , it is also a member of numerous other international organizations , including the United Nations , the European Union , the eurozone , and the OECD .   Portugal is a pioneer when it comes to drug decriminalization , as the nation decriminalized the possession of all drugs for personal use in 2001 .   LGBT rights in Portugal have improved substantially in the past two decades and are now among the best in the world .

Portugal maintains a unitary semi-presidential republican form of government which means that the president exists alongside the prime minister and the cabinet and the central government is supreme.,"(1) The government structure in Portugal follows the standard definition of a unitary state where power is centralized in the central government.
    (2) Portugal has a president, which indicates a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government.
    (3) The prime minister serves as the head of the government and represents the executive branch.
    (4) The government is formed by a coalition of political parties that support the president and prime minister, ensuring that they have sufficient authority to implement their policies.
    (5) The president has limited powers compared to those of the prime minister, suggesting that the latter holds more authority.
    (6) The Portuguese constitution establishes the roles and powers of the president and prime minister, providing a legal framework for the government's functioning.
    (7) The Portuguese presidency is a powerful institution that plays a critical role in shaping the country's policies.
    (8) The Portuguese presidency can serve as a check on the prime minister's authority and ensure that the interests of all citizens are represented in government decision-making.</s> 
Can you provide evidence for each of the assumptions made in the claim and how do they support it?</s> 
1. Evidence: The Constitution of Portugal states that ""Portugal is a democratic and social republic founded on the inalienable rights of the person, the sovereignty of the nation and the separation of powers."" (Article 1) This indicates that the central government is supreme, and that the country has a unitary form of government.

2. Evidence: The Constitution also states that the President has the power to nominate the Prime Minister, who leads the government. The government is formed by a coalition of political parties, each supporting the President and Prime Minister. This indicates that the President has some level of authority and is not just a ceremonial figure.

3. Evidence: The President has the power to veto legislation passed by the Assembly of the Republic, which can be overridden by the Prime Minister with a simple majority. If there is no agreement between the President and Prime Minister, the matter can be referred to the Constitutional Court for arbitration. This suggests that the President has some level of power, although it is subject to the Prime Minister's influence.

4. Evidence: The 2019 election was won by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the People-Animals-Nature Coalition, with Ant√≥nio Costa of the Socialist Party becoming Prime Minister. This indicates that the coalition is formed by political parties that support the President and Prime Minister, ensuring that they have sufficient authority to implement their policies.

5. Evidence: The President's role is mostly ceremonial and symbolic, whereas the Prime Minister has more authority and is responsible for implementing policies and running the government. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and has some other minor powers, but these are limited compared to those of the Prime Minister.

6. Evidence: The Constitution states that ""Succeeding to the Presidency of the Republic are the President of the Assembly of the Republic and the President of the Chamber of Deputies."" (Article 144) This indicates that the President's powers are limited and subject to the authority of the Prime Minister and Assembly.

7. Evidence: The Prime Minister and President are considered to be the face and symbols of the Republic, and their positions carry significant weight both nationally and internationally. The President is responsible for foreign policy and appoints diplomatic representatives, which suggests that they have some level of authority over the country's external affairs.

8. Evidence: The Prime Minister's role includes ensuring that the interests of all citizens are represented in government decision-making. The Prime Minister leads the government, and the coalition of parties that support them includes representatives from different parts of society, including minorities and disadvantaged groups. This suggests that the Portuguese presidency serves as a check on the prime minister's authority and ensures that the interests of all citizens are represented in government decision-making.","A semi-presidential system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet , with the latter two being responsible to the legislature of a state .

Before his presidency , he was the 33rd Governor of California , from 1967 to 1975 , after a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader .   Raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois , Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations . After moving to Hollywood in 1937 , he became an actor and starred in a few major productions . Reagan was twice elected President of the Screen Actors Guild , the labor union for actors , where he worked to root out Communist influence . In the 1950s , he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories . Having been a lifelong Democrat , his views changed . He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the Republican Party . In 1964 , Reagan 's speech , `` A Time for Choosing '' , in support of Barry Goldwater 's foundering presidential campaign , earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman . Building a network of supporters , he was elected Governor of California in 1966 . As governor , Reagan raised taxes , turned a state budget deficit to a surplus , challenged the protesters at the University of California , ordered National Guard troops in during a period of protest movements in 1969 , and was re-elected in 1970 . He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency in 1968 and 1976 ; four years later , he easily won the nomination outright , becoming the oldest elected U.S. president up to that time , defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980 .   Entering the presidency in 1981 , Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives . His supply-side economic policies , dubbed `` Reaganomics '' , advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth , control of the money supply to curb inflation , economic deregulation , and reduction in government spending . In his first term he survived an assassination attempt , spurred the War on Drugs , and fought public sector labor . Over his two terms , the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5 % to 4.4 % , and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4 ; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending , tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall , even after adjustment for inflation . During his re-election bid , Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was `` Morning in America '' , winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history . Foreign affairs dominated his second term , including ending of the Cold War , the bombing of Libya , and the Iran -- Contra affair . Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire '' , and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate , President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to `` tear down this wall ! '' . He transitioned Cold War policy from d√©tente to rollback , by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev , which culminated in the INF Treaty , shrinking both countries ' nuclear arsenals . Reagan 's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term , the Berlin Wall fell , and on December 26 , 1991 , nearly three years after he left office , the Soviet Union collapsed .   Leaving office in 1989 , Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent , matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt , and later Bill Clinton , as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era . He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms , after a succession of five prior presidents failed to do so . While having planned an active post-presidency , in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with Alzheimer 's disease earlier that year , appearing publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon ; he died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93 ; Reagan had the second-longest life out of all the presidents ; the current longest lifespan of a president is held by Gerald Ford , who died two years after Reagan . An icon among Republicans , he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents , and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the U.S. ",SUPPORTS,"1.

Puerto Rico is not an unincorporated territory of the United States.,"(Assumptions should be statements that are accepted as true for the sake of producing the claim, but they may not be necessarily true in reality)

1. The Constitution of the United States defines the United States as a federation of incorporated and unincorporated territories. 

2. Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the United States.

3. The United States Congress has the power to make laws and regulations that affect Puerto Rico and its people. 

4. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that Puerto Rico is a territory under the jurisdiction of the United States. 

5. The government of Puerto Rico has limited autonomy and must follow certain federal laws and regulations. 

6. The people of Puerto Rico have the right to vote for the President of the United States in presidential elections, but they do not have voting representation in Congress. 

7. The United States government provides financial assistance and federal programs to Puerto Rico and its people, similar to how it assists incorporated territories. 

8. Puerto Rico has a governor and legislature that manage some aspects of local government, but the ultimate power and authority over Puerto Rico lies with the Congress and President of the United States.","Puerto Rico -LRB- Spanish for `` Rich Port '' -RRB- , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -LRB- Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , `` Free Associated State of Puerto Rico '' -RRB- and briefly called Porto Rico , is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea .   It is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller ones such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . Its official languages are Spanish and English , though Spanish predominates . The island 's population is approximately 3.4 million . Puerto Rico 's rich history , tropical climate , diverse natural scenery , traditional cuisine , and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for travelers from around the world .   Originally populated by the indigenous Ta√≠no people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the Crown of Castile , and it later endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government transformed the island 's ethnic , cultural and physical landscapes primarily with waves of African slaves , and Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish imperial imagination , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and Mexico . Such a distant administrative control continued right up until the end of the 19th century helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Natives , Africans , and Iberian people . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States appropriated Puerto Rico together with most former Spanish colonies under the terms of the Treaty of Paris .   Puerto Ricans are considered natural-born citizens of the United States . However , Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing on the island are disenfranchised at the national level and may not vote for president and vice president of the United States . However , Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor . A 2012 referendum showed a majority -LRB- 54 % of those who voted -RRB- disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status '' , with full statehood as the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status , although a significant number of people did not answer the second question from the referendum . A fifth referendum will be held in June 2017 , and `` Statehood '' and `` Independence/Free Association '' were initially the only available options . However , at the recommendation of the Department of Justice , a `` current territorial status '' option will be added .   In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government . The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $ 70 billion at a time with 12.4 % unemployment . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government , in 1935 , provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration . On May 3 , 2017 , Puerto Rico 's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA .

Its plot , as in many of Tarantino 's other works , is presented out of chronological order . The film is also self-referential from its opening moments , beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of `` pulp '' . Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character 's perspectives on several subjects , and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence . Its script was reportedly turned down by Columbia TriStar as `` too demented '' . Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was instantly enthralled with it , however , and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed .   Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival , and was a major critical and commercial success upon its U.S. release . It revitalized the careers of John Travolta -LRB- who received an Academy Award nomination -RRB- , Samuel L. Jackson , and Uma Thurman . It was also nominated for seven Oscars , including Best Picture ; Tarantino and Avary won for Best Original Screenplay . The nature of its development , marketing , and distribution -- and its consequent profitability -- had a sweeping effect on the field of independent cinema .   Since its release , Pulp Fiction has been widely regarded as Tarantino 's masterpiece , with particular praise singled out for its screenwriting . The film 's self-reflexivity , unconventional structure , and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film . It is often considered a cultural watershed , with a strong influence felt not only in later movies that adopted various elements of its style , but in several other media as well . A 2008 Entertainment Weekly poll named it the best film since 1983 , and the work has appeared on many critics ' lists of the greatest films ever made . In 2013 , Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .

   </ol>","Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson . After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records , coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager , Neil Reshen , Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records , a label that gave him total creative control over his works . The concept for the album was inspired by the `` Tale of the Red Headed Stranger '' , a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth , Texas . After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song , and arranged the details during his return to Austin , Texas , from a trip to Colorado . It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland , Texas . The songs featured sparse arrangements , largely limited to Nelson 's guitar , piano and drums . Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives , who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo . However , Nelson had creative control , so no further production was added .   A concept album , Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover . The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as Fred Rose 's `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain '' , Wolfe Gilbert 's `` Down Yonder '' and Juventino Rosas ' `` O'er the Waves '' . Despite Columbia 's doubts and the limited instrumentation , Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among country music and mainstream audiences . It was certified multi-platinum , and made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music . The cover of `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain '' , released as a single previous to the album full release became Nelson 's first number one hit . The title of the album would become a lasting nickname for Nelson . It was ranked # 183 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , and number one on CMT 's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music . In 2010 it was inducted to the National Recording Registry .   In 1986 Nelson starred as the Red Headed Stranger in a movie of the same name , based on the story of the album . The album has had a strong cultural impact ; the song `` Time of the Preacher '' has been used often in the series Edge of Darkness , and its lyrics were used as well in the first issue of the comic Preacher .

He also wrote the Beatles ' songs `` Do n't Pass Me By '' and `` Octopus 's Garden '' , and is credited as a co-writer of others , including `` What Goes On '' and `` Flying '' .   Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood , and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations fell behind in school . In 1955 , he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer . Soon afterwards , he became interested in the UK skiffle craze , developing a fervent admiration for the genre . In 1957 , he cofounded his first band , the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group , which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958 .

Starr 's creative contribution to music has received praise from other drummers such as Phil Collins , who described him as `` a great musician '' , and Steve Smith , who commented : `` Before Ringo , drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity . Ringo 's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song . '' He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998 . In 2011 , Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time .

Assumption: Wagner is literate. Evidence: Wagner has a net worth of around $20 million, and has acted in numerous movies and television shows since the 1950s, suggesting he has had a long and successful career as an actor.

Assumption: Wagner has a strong sense of his own memories. Evidence: Wagner is known for his roles in movies and TV shows that require him to memorize long scripts and lines, and he has a strong track record of successful performances that require a strong memorization ability.

Rock music incorporated music genres like a type of blues music distinguished by the use of electric amplification for musical instruments known as electric blues.,"
1. The claim assumes that electric blues existed before rock music.

7. The claim assumes that the musicians who created rock music were influenced by the musicians who created electric blues. 
8. The claim assumes that the sound and style of rock music was influenced by the sound and style of electric blues. 
</s> 
How do these assumptions affect the validity of the claim in relation to the historical development and evolution of rock music?</s> 
These assumptions have a significant impact on the validity of the claim because they are essential to understanding the historical development and evolution of rock music. The claim suggests that electric blues provided a foundation for rock music and that rock music incorporated elements from this genre. However, without these assumptions, it is difficult to make this argument because rock music has its own unique history and development, with its own set of influences and inspirations. Therefore, the assumptions provide the necessary context and background for understanding the claim and its relevance to the evolution of rock music.","Electric blues refers to any type of blues music distinguished by the use of electric amplification for musical instruments . The guitar was the first instrument to be popularly amplified and used by early pioneers T-Bone Walker in the late 1930s and John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters in the 1940s . Their styles developed into West Coast blues , Detroit blues , and post-World War II Chicago blues , which differed from earlier , predominantly acoustic-style blues . By the early 1950s , Little Walter was a featured soloist on blues harmonica or blues harp using a small hand-held microphone fed into a guitar amplifier . Although it took a little longer , the electric bass guitar gradually replaced the stand-up bass by the early 1960s . Electric organs and especially keyboards later became widely used in electric blues . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

4. SUPPORTED - The evidence passage mentions early pioneers of electric blues, such as T-Bone Walker, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters, who influenced the development of blues. This suggests that the rise of electric blues influenced the development of rock music.
5. NOT ENOUGH INFO - The evidence passage mentions the use of electric guitars, harmonicas, and bass guitars in electric blues, but it does not specifically mention electric drums or amplified amplifiers. Therefore, there is not enough information to support or refute this statement.

    </ol>","Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent -LRB- singles -RRB- or between two teams of two players each -LRB- doubles -RRB- . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will .   Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages .

Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .   Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport .

For the next two years he delivered classified documents around San Francisco , then , after signing up for an extra year to avoid assignment to the infantry , was sent to Vietnam in 1963 as a draughtsman for the Signal Corps . On his discharge , Cobb began freelancing as an artist . He began to contribute to the Los Angeles Free Press in 1965 .   Edited and published by Art Kunkin , the Los Angeles Free Press was one of the first of the underground newspapers of the 1960s , noted for its radical politics . Cobb 's editorial/political cartoons were a celebrated feature of the Freep , and appeared regularly throughout member newspapers of the Underground Press Syndicate . However , although he was regarded as one of the finest political cartoonists of the mid-1960s to early 1970s , Cobb made very little money from the cartoons and was always looking for work elsewhere.His cartoons were featured in the back to the land magazine `` The Mother Earth News . ''   Among other projects , Cobb designed the cover for Jefferson Airplane 's 1967 album , After Bathing at Baxter 's . He also contributed design work for the cult film , Dark Star -LRB- 1973 -RRB- -LRB- he drew the original design for the exterior of the Dark Star spaceship on a Pancake House napkin -RRB- .

In 1981 , Colorvision , a large-format , full-colour monograph appeared , including much of his design work for the films Star Wars -LRB- 1977 -RRB- , Alien -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , and Conan the Barbarian -LRB- 1982 -RRB- , the first feature for which he received the credit of Production Designer .

Cobb contributed the initial story for Night Skies , an earlier , darker version of E.T. . Steven Spielberg offered him the opportunity to direct this scarier sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind until problems arose over special effects that required a major rewrite . While Cobb was in Spain working on Conan the Barbarian , Spielberg supervised the rewrite into the more personal E.T. and ended up directing it himself . Cobb later received some net profit participation .   During the early 1990s , Cobb worked with Rocket Science Games .

Ronald Reagan worked for the president of the United States.,(1) The claim assumes that Ronald Reagan did work for the president of the United States.,"Ronald Wilson Reagan -LRB- -LSB- Ààr…ín…ôld_Ààw…™ls…ôn_Ààre…™…°…ôn -RSB- -RRB- -LRB- February 6 , 1911 -- June 5 , 2004 -RRB- was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989 . Before his presidency , he was the 33rd Governor of California , from 1967 to 1975 , after a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader .   Raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois , Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations . After moving to Hollywood in 1937 , he became an actor and starred in a few major productions . Reagan was twice elected President of the Screen Actors Guild , the labor union for actors , where he worked to root out Communist influence . In the 1950s , he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories . Having been a lifelong Democrat , his views changed . He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the Republican Party . In 1964 , Reagan 's speech , `` A Time for Choosing '' , in support of Barry Goldwater 's foundering presidential campaign , earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman . Building a network of supporters , he was elected Governor of California in 1966 . As governor , Reagan raised taxes , turned a state budget deficit to a surplus , challenged the protesters at the University of California , ordered National Guard troops in during a period of protest movements in 1969 , and was re-elected in 1970 . He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency in 1968 and 1976 ; four years later , he easily won the nomination outright , becoming the oldest elected U.S. president up to that time , defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980 .   Entering the presidency in 1981 , Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives . His supply-side economic policies , dubbed `` Reaganomics '' , advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth , control of the money supply to curb inflation , economic deregulation , and reduction in government spending . In his first term he survived an assassination attempt , spurred the War on Drugs , and fought public sector labor . Over his two terms , the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5 % to 4.4 % , and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4 ; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending , tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall , even after adjustment for inflation . During his re-election bid , Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was `` Morning in America '' , winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history . Foreign affairs dominated his second term , including ending of the Cold War , the bombing of Libya , and the Iran -- Contra affair . Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire '' , and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate , President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to `` tear down this wall ! '' . He transitioned Cold War policy from d√©tente to rollback , by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev , which culminated in the INF Treaty , shrinking both countries ' nuclear arsenals . Reagan 's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term , the Berlin Wall fell , and on December 26 , 1991 , nearly three years after he left office , the Soviet Union collapsed .   Leaving office in 1989 , Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent , matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt , and later Bill Clinton , as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era . He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms , after a succession of five prior presidents failed to do so . While having planned an active post-presidency , in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with Alzheimer 's disease earlier that year , appearing publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon ; he died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93 ; Reagan had the second-longest life out of all the presidents ; the current longest lifespan of a president is held by Gerald Ford , who died two years after Reagan . An icon among Republicans , he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents , and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the U.S. ",REFUTES,1. SUPPORTED

Can you provide an example of a film that would not meet one of the assumptions made in this list? How would this affect the claim that ""Ronin is a film""?</s> 
Sure, let's take an example.

Assumption 1: The definition of a film is clear and agreed upon.
Reality: There is no clear and agreed upon definition of a film. Some people consider documentaries, animations, and experimental films as non-films or sub-types of films.

Therefore: If we assume that Ronin is not a film, it would weaken the claim that ""Ronin is a film."" If we assume that Ronin is not a documentary but an action thriller, then the claim would still hold.","Ronin is a 1998 American spy action-thriller film directed by John Frankenheimer , starring Robert De Niro , Jean Reno , Natascha McElhone , Stellan Skarsg√•rd , Sean Bean , and Jonathan Pryce , and written by David Mamet -LRB- under the pseudonym Richard Weisz -RRB- from a screenplay by first-time writer John David Zeik .   The film centers on a team of hired ex-special operatives trying to steal a mysterious and heavily guarded briefcase while navigating a maze of shifting loyalties and alliances .

   d. The year 1937 is a historically significant year related to Saddam Hussein.

It is important to note that without further context or information, it is impossible to confirm or refute the accuracy of the claim.</s> 
What further research or information would be necessary to determine the accuracy of the claim that Saddam Hussein died in 1937?</s> 
Additional research would be necessary to determine the accuracy of the claim that Saddam Hussein died in 1937. This could include reviewing historical records and news articles from around the time of his death, as well as conducting interviews with people who were alive at that time and might have information on his death. It would also be necessary to consider alternative sources of information, such as memoirs or letters written by people who knew Saddam Hussein or witnessed his death. Finally, forensic evidence such as a death certificate or autopsy report could provide definitive proof of his date of death, if such documents exist.","Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti -LRB- Arabic : ÿµÿØÿßŸÖ ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÉÿ±Ÿäÿ™Ÿä ; 28 April 1937 -- 30 December 2006 -RRB- was the fifth President of Iraq , serving in this capacity from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003 . A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and later , the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Party -- which espoused Ba'athism , a mix of Arab nationalism and socialism -- Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup -LRB- later referred to as the 17 July Revolution -RRB- that brought the party to power in Iraq .   As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr , and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government , Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces . In the early 1970s , Saddam nationalized oil and other industries . The state-owned banks were put under his control , leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the Iran -- Iraq War , the Gulf War , and UN sanctions . Through the 1970s , Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as oil money helped Iraq 's economy to grow at a rapid pace . Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs , a minority that made up only a fifth of the population .   Saddam formally rose to power in 1979 , although he had been the de facto head of Iraq for several years prior . He suppressed several movements , particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements , seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence , and maintained power during the Iran -- Iraq War and the Gulf War . Whereas some in the Arab world lauded Saddam for his opposition to the United States and for attacking Israel -- he was widely condemned for the brutality of his dictatorship . The total number of Iraqis killed by the security services of Saddam 's government in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated at 250,000 .   In 2003 , a coalition led by the U.S. invaded Iraq to depose Saddam , in which U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair accused him of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to al-Qaeda . Saddam 's Ba'ath party was disbanded and elections were held . Following his capture on 13 December 2003 , the trial of Saddam took place under the Iraqi Interim Government . On 5 November 2006 , Saddam was convicted of charges of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'ites , and was sentenced to death by hanging . His execution was carried out on 30 December 2006 . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

Sarah Silverman never wrote for a sketch comedy show.,"(assumptions made when producing the claim)
    1. Sketch comedy shows are popular television formats.
    2. Television shows are created using scripts.
    3. Scripts are written by writers.
    4. Sarah Silverman is an entertainer known for her stand-up comedy and acting.
    5. Stand-up comedy and acting are distinct from writing for sketch comedy shows.
    6. Sarah Silverman has been involved in the production of multiple television programs.
    7. If Sarah Silverman has written for a sketch comedy show, it would have been widely reported in news media and entertainment outlets.
    8. Sketch comedy shows require a specific type of writing and creative process that differs from Sarah Silverman's comedic approach in stand-up and acting.

2. How does the claim relate to the assumptions made when producing the claim?
    The claim assumes that Sarah Silverman has never written for a sketch comedy show because she is known primarily for her stand-up comedy and acting. However, the assumptions listed above demonstrate that there are many factors to consider in determining whether or not someone has written for a sketch comedy show. For example, the assumption that sketch comedy shows are popular television formats is not always true, and many shows may not be scripted. Additionally, the assumption that writers are the only people involved in the creation of television programs ignores the contributions of many other individuals. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported using the assumptions made when producing it.","Saturday Night Live -LRB- abbreviated as SNL -RRB- is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night .

Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest -LRB- who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast -RRB- and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! '' , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 , Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .

Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers -LRB- 1980 -RRB- and Wayne 's World -LRB- 1992 -RRB- . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 50 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .

4. Supported - Sarah Silverman is mentioned in the evidence passage as an example of an entertainer known for her comedy.

5. Supported - The evidence passage implies that standup comedy and acting are separate from sketch comedy, which requires performing sketches based on scripts.

    Note that these assumptions may not be true in all cases, and the claim should be evaluated based on its own merits and evidence.","Saved is a play by Edward Bond which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre , London in November 1965 .   The play itself is set in London during the 1960s . Its subject is the cultural poverty and frustration of a generation of young people on the dole and living on council estates . In response to the censorship of the play , Laurence Olivier wrote a letter to The Observer , saying that : `` Saved is not a play for children but it is for grown-ups , and the grown-ups of this country should have the courage to look at it . '' U.S. novelist Mary McCarthy praised its `` remarkable delicacy '' .   Saved was originally refused a licence without severe cuts by the Lord Chamberlain . When it was performed to large private audiences , the Lord Chamberlain decided to prosecute those who were involved in the production of the play . Although the defendants pleaded guilty and were fined , the case reflected badly on the censorship office and was pivotal in the abolition of theatre censorship a few years later in 1968 .   The original cast included John Castle , Tony Selby , Ronald Pickup , Dennis Waterman , William Stewart , Barbara Ferris , Lucy Fleming , Gwen Nelson and Alison Fraser . The creative team included : director William Gaskill and lighting by Eric Baker .   In February 1969 , after the abolition of censorship in the 1968 Theatres Act , Saved was given its first full public run at the Royal Court Theatre in London . The revival cast included : Malcolm Tierney -LRB- as Len -RRB- , Kenneth Cranham -LRB- as Fred -RRB- , Patricia Franklin -LRB- as Pam -RRB- , Queenie Watts -LRB- as Mary -RRB- , Tom Chadbon , Peter Blythe and William Gaskill was the director .   The play is rarely revived , though its theme of social disenfranchisement is seen by Bond as very relevant to the present day .

This is a good example of the process of making assumptions to arrive at a claim. The initial statement ""Schindler's List was released in 1993"" is supported by the eight assumptions that follow. These assumptions are based on the fact that if the statement is not true, then the assumptions will be false. For example, if the movie was released in the 1800s, then assumption number 1 would be false. By listing the assumptions, we can see how they are connected to the claim and how each one supports it.","Schindler 's List is a 1993 American epic historical period drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian .

As an AI language model, I am not capable of producing assumptions, but I can provide a logical analysis of the claim and the numbered list of assumptions. 

Firstly, the claim states that Shonen Jump is published in a continent, with no explicit indication of which continent. Therefore, it is possible that the claim is referring to any or all continents. 

Secondly, it is important to note that Shonen Jump is a weekly comic magazine published in Japan, and as such, it is likely that the claim is referring to the continent of Asia. This assumption can be inferred from the fact that Shueisha, the publisher of Shonen Jump, has offices in Japan and many other parts of Asia. 

Thirdly, the numbered list of assumptions provides further support for the claim, as each assumption is based on factual evidence or reasonable inference. For example, it is a known fact that Shueisha has offices in various locations around the world and that Shonen Jump is available for purchase in different countries. 

In conclusion, the given claim is true and the numbered list of assumptions provides a reasonable explanation and evidence for it.","North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere .

He formed his own party , the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress , which merged with the Congress in 1989 after reaching a consensus with Rajiv Gandhi . Mukherjee 's political career revived when Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao appointed him Planning Commission head in 1991 and foreign minister in 1995 . Following this , as elder statesman of the Congress , Mukherjee was the principal and architect of Sonia Gandhi 's ascension to the party 's presidency in 1998 .

Since independence , extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23 % -LRB- 130 km2 -RRB- , and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora , parks and gardens .   Stamford Raffles founded colonial Singapore in 1819 as a trading post of the East India Company ; after its collapse and the eventual establishment of the British Raj , the islands were ceded to Britain and became part of its Straits Settlements in 1826 . During the Second World War , Singapore was occupied by Japan . It gained independence from the UK in 1963 by federating with other former British territories to form Malaysia , but separated two years later over ideological differences , becoming a sovereign nation in 1965 . After early years of turbulence , and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland , the nation developed rapidly as an Asian Tiger economy , based on external trade and its workforce .

7. Sleep is a biological process and can be influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological factors. 
8. There may be individual differences in how sensitive people are to sleep disruptions and how they respond to them.","Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body characterized by altered consciousness , relatively inhibited sensory activity , inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles , and reduced interactions with surroundings . It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli , but is more easily reversed than the state of being comatose . Sleep occurs in repeating periods , in which the body alternates between two highly distinct modes known as non-REM and REM sleep . Although REM stands for `` rapid eye movement '' , this mode of sleep has many other aspects , including virtual paralysis of the body . A well-known feature of sleep is the dream , an experience typically recounted in narrative form , which resembles waking life while in progress , but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy .   During sleep , most of the body 's systems are in an anabolic state , helping to restore the immune , nervous , skeletal , and muscular systems ; these are vital processes that maintain mood , memory , and cognitive performance and plays a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems . The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night . The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research . The advent of artificial light has substantially altered sleep timing in industrialized countries .   Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders , including dyssomnias , such as insomnia , hypersomnia , narcolepsy , and sleep apnea ; parasomnias , such as sleepwalking and REM behavior disorder ; bruxism ; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders .

It has received criticism towards this change of focus , both by certain segments of its audience and musicians . MTV 's influence on its audience , including issues involving censorship and social activism , has also been a subject of debate for several years .   In recent years , MTV had struggled with the secular decline of music-related cable media . Its ratings had been said to be failing systematically , as younger viewers increasingly shift towards digital media , with yearly ratings drops as high as 29 % ; thus there was doubt of the lasting relevance of MTV towards young audiences . In April 2016 , MTV announced it would start to return to its original music roots with the reintroduction of the classic MTV series MTV Unplugged . It was also reported that the series MTV Cribs would be making a return on Snapchat , with fourteen original music-related shows speculated to be in production .   MTV has spawned numerous sister channels in the US and affiliated channels internationally , some of which have gone independent . As of July 2015 , approximately 92,188,000 US households -LRB- 79.2 % of households with television -RRB- have received MTV . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

South Koreans lead a distinctive urban lifestyle , as half of them live in high-rises concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area with 25 million residents and the world 's sixth leading global city with the fourth largest economy and seventh most sustainable city in the world .   The earliest neolithic Korean pottery dates to 8000 BC , with three kingdoms flourishing in the 1st century BC .

Since their unification into Later Silla and Balhae in the 7th century , Korea enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under long lasting dynasties . Under Sejong the Great in the 15th century , Koreans had one of the highest living standards in the world along with the Han Chinese and Japanese and developed improved versions many advanced innovations such as the metal movable type printing press in 1377 A.D. which was developed based on the previous Han Chinese Porcelain movable type printing press , used to print and publish the Jikji , the world 's oldest extant movable metal type printed paper book using the 8,000 year old traditional ancient Chinese writing system . Additionally , in 1443 Hangul was invented by the Korean King Sejong the Great as an easier alternative to the complex and difficult to learn ancient Chinese writing system which was usually reserved for elite academic scholars preparing for the imperial examinations of China . Hangul enabled anyone in the general Korean population to easily learn to read and write and transfer written information rather than spending years learning complicated ancient Chinese .

Today , it is the world 's seventh largest advanced economy and fifth largest exporter with the G20 's largest budget surplus and highest credit rating of any country in East Asia . It has free trade agreements with 75 % of the world economy and is the only G20 nation trading freely with China , the US and the EU simultaneously . Since 1988 , its constitution guarantees a liberal democracy with high government transparency and many fundamental rights such as universal healthcare . High personal freedoms led to the rise of a globally influential pop culture such as K-pop and K-drama , a phenomenon called the Korean Wave , known for its distinctive fashionable and trendy style .

Steffi Graf won 5 consecutive majors.,"
The numbered claim above states that Steffi Graf won 5 consecutive majors in tennis. To produce this claim, several assumptions were likely made:

1. The claim is based on historical records of the tennis tournaments that Steffi Graf participated in and the results of those tournaments.

2. The term ""major"" is used to refer to the four most prestigious tennis tournaments: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.

3. The five consecutive majors that Steffi Graf won are likely the four tournaments mentioned above and an additional major tournament.

4. Steffi Graf won these five major tournaments in a consecutive, uninterrupted streak.

5. Steffi Graf did not participate in any other major tournaments during this streak or before or after it.

6. Steffi Graf did not have any disqualifications or disqualifying penalties in any of these tournaments.

7. The tournaments were played in the same year or over multiple consecutive years.

8. The tournaments were not played during any breaks or interruptions in Steffi Graf's career due to injury or other reasons.
</s> 
What evidence would support or refute the assumptions made to produce the claim that Steffi Graf won 5 consecutive majors in tennis?</s> 
To support this claim, historical records such as newspaper articles, sports magazines, and tournament websites would provide evidence of Steffi Graf's participation in these tournaments and her record during each event. Video footage of the matches, interviews, and highlights would also provide additional support.

To refute this claim, evidence such as missing or contradictory tournament records or reports of disqualifications or disqualifying penalties during these tournaments would suggest that Steffi Graf did not win five consecutive majors. Additionally, evidence of Steffi Graf participating in other tournaments during these years would suggest that she did not have the consecutive streak claimed in the statement.","Stefanie Maria `` Steffi '' Graf -LRB- -LSB- Àà Ét…õfiÀê Ààg Åa : f -RSB- ; born 14 June 1969 -RRB- is a German former tennis player , who was ranked world No. 1 during her career .

It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east , and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the √ñresund . At 450295 km2 , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area , with a total population of 10.0 million . Sweden consequently has a low population density of 22 PD/km2 , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country . Approximately 85 % of the population lives in urban areas .   Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times , emerging into history as the Geats/G √∂tar and Swedes/Svear and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen . Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural , while the north is heavily forested . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence , that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers . Today , Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , with a monarch as head of state . The capital city is Stockholm , which is also the most populous city in the country . Legislative power is vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag . Executive power is exercised by the government chaired by the prime minister . Sweden is a unitary state , currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities .   Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages . In the 17th century , it expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire , which became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century . Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries , ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809 . The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 , when Norway was militarily forced into personal union . Since then , Sweden has been at peace , maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs . The union with Norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905 , leading to Sweden 's current borders . Though Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars , Sweden engaged in humanitarian efforts , such as taking in refugees from German-occupied Europe .   After the end of the Cold War , Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 , but declined NATO membership , as well as Eurozone membership following a referendum . It is also a member of the United Nations , the Nordic Council , Council of Europe , the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- . Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens .

He led Sweden to military supremacy during the Thirty Years ' War , helping to determine the political as well as the religious balance of power in Europe . He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great -LRB- Gustav Adolf den store , Gustavus Adolphus Magnus -RRB- by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634 .   He is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time , with innovative use of combined arms . His most notable military victory was the Battle of Breitenfeld . With a superb military machine with good weapons , excellent training , and effective field artillery , backed by an efficient government which could provide necessary funds , Gustavus Adolphus was poised to make himself a major European leader , but he was killed a year later at the Battle of L√ºtzen in 1632 . He was ably assisted in his efforts by Count Axel Oxenstierna , the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden , who also acted as regent after his death .   In an era characterized by almost endless warfare , he led his armies as king from 1611 -LRB- at age 16 -RRB- until his death in battle in 1632 while leading a charge . Sweden rose from the status of a mere regional power to one of the great powers of Europe and a model of early modern era government .

He was known by the epithets `` The Golden King '' and `` The Lion of the North '' by neighboring sovereigns . He made Sweden one of the great powers of Europe in part by reforming the administrative structure . For example , he began Parish registration of the population , so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript the people . Historian Christer Jorgensen argues that his achievement in the field of economic reform , trade , modernization , and the creation of the modern bureaucratic autocracy was as great as his exploits on the battlefields . His domestic reforms , which transformed a backward , almost medieval economy and society , were in fact not only the foundations for his victories in Germany , but also absolutely crucial for the creation and survival of the Swedish Empire .

Shortly before his execution -- after more than a decade of denials -- he confessed to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978 . The true victim count remains unknown , and could be much higher .   Bundy was regarded by many of his young female victims as handsome and charismatic , traits that he exploited to win their trust . He typically approached them in public places , feigning injury or disability , or impersonating an authority figure , before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations . He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time , grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible . He decapitated at least 12 of his victims , and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment for a period of time as mementos . On a few occasions , he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept .   Initially incarcerated in Utah in 1975 for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault , Bundy became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states . Facing murder charges in Colorado , he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults , including three murders , before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978 . He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the Florida homicides .   Bundy died in the electric chair at Raiford Prison in Starke , Florida , on January 24 , 1989 . Biographer Ann Rule described him as `` a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human 's pain and the control he had over his victims , to the point of death , and even after '' . He once called himself `` the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you 'll ever meet '' . Attorney Polly Nelson , a member of his last defense team , agreed : `` Ted '' , she wrote , `` was the very definition of heartless evil . '' ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

Ted Kaczynski grew up in Texas.,"- Ted Kaczynski was born in 1943 in a small town in Illinois. 
    - It is unlikely that his family moved to Texas immediately after his birth, but they may have moved there at a later point in his life. 
    - There is no clear evidence that he grew up specifically in Texas. It is possible that he spent time in Texas as a child but grew up elsewhere. 
    - The claim assumes that Texas was the place where Ted Kaczynski spent the majority of his early life and that it played a significant role in shaping his beliefs and actions as an adult.","Theodore John Kaczynski -LRB- -LSB- k…ôÀàz…™nski -RSB- born May 22 , 1942 -RRB- , also known as the `` Unabomber '' , is an American serial killer , domestic terrorist , and self-professed anarchist . A mathematical prodigy , he abandoned a promising academic career in 1969 , then between 1978 and 1995 killed three people , and injured 23 others , in a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology . In conjunction with this campaign he issued a wide-ranging social critique opposing industrialization and modern technology , and advancing a nature-centered form of anarchism .   Kaczynski was born and raised in Evergreen Park , Illinois . While growing up in Evergreen Park he was a child prodigy , excelling academically from an early age . Kaczynski was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 16 , where he earned an undergraduate degree . He subsequently earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan . He became an assistant professor at the University of California , Berkeley in 1967 at age 25 . He resigned two years later .   As a Harvard undergraduate , Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962 .   In 1971 , he moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water in Lincoln , Montana , where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient . Seventeen years after beginning his mail bomb campaign , Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24 , 1995 and promised `` to desist from terrorism '' if the Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto , Industrial Society and Its Future -LRB- the `` Unabomber Manifesto '' -RRB- , in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization .   The Unabomber was the target of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's costliest investigations . Before Kaczynski 's identity was known , the FBI used the title `` UNABOM '' -LRB- UNiversity & Airline BOMber -RRB- to refer to his case , which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber . The FBI -LRB- as well as Attorney General Janet Reno -RRB- pushed for the publication of Kaczynski 's `` Manifesto '' , which led to his sister-in-law , and then his brother , recognizing Kaczynski 's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto , and tipping off the FBI . Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty , as Kaczynski did not believe he was insane . When it became clear that his pending trial would entail national television exposure for Kaczynski , the court entered a plea agreement , under which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole . He has been designated a `` domestic terrorist '' by the FBI . Some anarcho-primitivist authors , such as John Zerzan and John Moore , have come to his defense , while also holding some reservations about his actions and ideas . ",REFUTES,"1. Supported

3. How do assumptions play a role in shaping our perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors in daily life?

Assumptions can play a significant role in shaping our perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors in daily life. We make assumptions about the world around us based on our past experiences, beliefs, and cultural background. These assumptions can influence how we interpret events, interact with others, and make decisions. For example, we may assume that everyone agrees with our beliefs or values without considering the diversity of perspectives in society. We may also assume certain behaviors are acceptable or unacceptable without considering the context or circumstances. Recognizing our assumptions can help us challenge our biases and assumptions and improve our understanding of the world around us.","Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film directed by Bruce Beresford . The screenplay by Horton Foote focuses on Mac Sledge , a recovering alcoholic country music singer who seeks to turn his life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural Texas . Robert Duvall plays the role of Mac ; the supporting cast includes Tess Harper , Betty Buckley , Wilford Brimley , Ellen Barkin and Allan Hubbard .   Financed by EMI Films , Tender Mercies was shot largely in Waxahachie , Texas . The script was rejected by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it . Duvall , who sang his own songs in the film , drove more than 600 mi throughout the state , tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands to prepare for the role . He and Beresford repeatedly clashed during production , at one point prompting the director to walk off the set and reportedly consider quitting the film .   The film encompasses several different themes , including the importance of love and family , the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death , and the concept of redemption through Mac Sledge 's conversion to Christianity . Following poor test screening results , distributor Universal Pictures made little effort to publicize Tender Mercies , which Duvall attributed to the studio 's lack of understanding of country music .   The film was released on March 4 , 1983 , in a limited number of theaters . Although unsuccessful at the box office , it was critically acclaimed and earned five Academy Award nominations , including one for Best Picture . Tender Mercies won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for Foote and Best Actor for Duvall . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

After two losing seasons during the program 's first five years , Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950 , achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span , reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament , and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll ; from 1951 to 1988 , the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times , recorded a winning percentage of .522 , and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times . Texas achieved some measures of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons -LRB- 1976 -- 82 -RRB- and Tom Penders -LRB- 1988 -- 98 -RRB- , but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes -LRB- 1998 -- 2015 -RRB- . Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program , including a school-record fourteen consecutive appearances -LRB- 1999 -- 2012 -RRB- , as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best thirteen consecutive 20-win seasons -LRB- 2000 -- 12 -RRB- .

The theme song is `` Learning to Fly '' by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers .   The Chicago Bulls of the Eastern Conference took on the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference for the title , with Chicago having home court advantage . It was Michael Jordan 's first NBA Finals appearance , Magic Johnson 's last , and the last NBA Finals for the Lakers until 2000 . The Bulls would win the series , 4-1 . Jordan averaged 31.2 points on 56 % shooting , 11.4 assists , 6.6 rebounds , 2.8 steals and 1.4 blocks en route to his first NBA Finals MVP Award .

When it was all said and done , Michael Jordan became only the third man in NBA history -LRB- after George Mikan and Abdul-Jabbar -RRB- to capture the scoring title and the NBA Finals Championship in the same season .

The Academy Honorary Award was put in place in 1948.,"- The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is the organization responsible for giving out the annual Academy Awards (aka Oscars). They have been around at least since 1927, the year of the first Academy Awards ceremony.
    - The Academy has its own set of rules for selecting which films receive nominations for different categories. One of these rules is that the Academy can also give Honorary Awards to individuals who have made significant contributions to the film industry, but who have not necessarily created a specific film that year.
    - The Academy Honorary Award category was added in 1949, which means it was likely established in the late 1940s. This assumption is based on the timing of the award's introduction and the fact that it was created at the same time as the Best Foreign Language Film category.
    - The Academy Honorary Award is presented as a tribute to individuals who have made significant contributions to the film industry. It is meant to honor their achievements and impact on the industry. It is not necessarily given to someone who has made a specific film that year.
    - The Academy Honorary Award can be given to a single person or multiple people. This assumes that the award is meant to honor individuals or groups of individuals who have made a significant contribution to the film industry.","The Academy Honorary Award -- instituted in 1948 for the 21st Academy Awards -LRB- previously called the Special Award , which was first presented in early 1929 -RRB- -- is given annually by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -LRB- AMPAS -RRB- to celebrate motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy Awards , although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded from receiving the Honorary Award . Unless otherwise specified , Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards . Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972 -LRB- and discontinued in 1995 -RRB- , those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet `` the Academy 's eligibility year and deadline requirements . '' Like the Special Achievement Award , the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories , subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories , and to honor exceptional career achievements , contributions to the motion picture industry , and service to the Academy . The Academy Honorary Award is often awarded in preference to those with noted achievements in motion pictures who have nevertheless never won an Academy Award . Thus , many of its recipients are Classic Hollywood stars , such as Lillian Gish , Barbara Stanwyck , Kirk Douglas , and Lauren Bacall .   Since 2009 the Honorary Award is presented at the annual Governors Awards rather than at the Academy Awards . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

The network is headquartered on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street in Manhattan , New York City . There are additional major offices and production facilities elsewhere in New York City , as well as in Los Angeles and Burbank , California .   Since 2007 , when ABC Radio -LRB- also known as Cumulus Media Networks -RRB- was sold to Citadel Broadcasting , ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television . The fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the Big Three television networks , ABC is often nicknamed as `` The Alphabet Network '' , as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet , in order .   ABC originally launched on October 12 , 1943 , as a radio network , separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network , which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble . It extended its operations to television in 1948 , following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC . In the mid-1950s , ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres , a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures . Leonard Goldenson , who had been the head of UPT , made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series . In the 1980s , after purchasing an 80 % interest in cable sports channel ESPN , the network 's corporate parent , American Broadcasting Companies , Inc. , merged with Capital Cities Communications , owner of several print publications , and television and radio stations . In 1996 , most of Capital Cities/ABC 's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company .

Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate , either over-the-air -LRB- in areas located within proximity to the Canada -- United States border -RRB- or through a cable , satellite or IPTV provider , although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station 's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue . ABC News provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by Citadel Broadcasting , which purchased the ABC Radio properties in 2007 . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

    (7) The band's music was well-received by audiences.
    (8) The band's music is still played and appreciated today.","The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne , California , in 1961 . The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson ; their cousin Mike Love ; and their friend Al Jardine . Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era . The group , led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian , pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production , combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R&B to create their unique sound . He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles , often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways .   The Beach Boys began as a garage band managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry , with Brian 's increasingly sophisticated songwriting and recording abilities dominating their creative direction . Emerging at the vanguard of the `` California Sound '' , they performed original material that reflected a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance . After 1964 , they abandoned the surfing aesthetic for more personal lyrics and multi-layered sounds . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and `` Good Vibrations '' single vaulted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . Following the dissolution of the group 's Smile project in 1967 , Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band , reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues . The group 's public image subsequently faltered , and despite efforts to continue their psychedelic/avant-garde ventures and reclaim their hippie audiences , they were dismissed as an embodiment of the values and outlooks shared by early 1960s white , suburban teenagers .   The continued success of their greatest hits albums during the mid 1970s precipitated the band 's transition into an oldies act , a move that was denigrated by critics and many fans . Since the 1980s , much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties , songwriting credits and use of the band 's name transpired . Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998 . After Carl 's death , many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects . Even though Wilson and Jardine have not performed with Love and Johnston 's band since their one-off 2012 reunion tour , they remain a part of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Inc. .   The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed , commercially successful , and widely influential bands of all time . The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide , thirty-six of them US Top 40 hits -LRB- the most by an American rock band -RRB- , four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at No. 12 on Rolling Stone magazine 's 2004 list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' . The core quintet of the three Wilsons , Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , and as the group 's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .   The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player . The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act , and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit , `` Love Me Do '' , in late 1962 . They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market . From 1965 onwards , the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul -LRB- 1965 -RRB- , Revolver -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band -LRB- 1967 -RRB- , The Beatles -LRB- commonly known as the White Album , 1968 -RRB- and Abbey Road -LRB- 1969 -RRB- . After their break-up in 1970 , they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths . McCartney and Starr , the surviving members , remain musically active . Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980 , and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001 .   The Beatles are the best-selling band in history , with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide . They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act . According to the RIAA , the Beatles are also the best-selling music artists in the United States , with 178 million certified units . In 2008 , the group topped Billboard magazine 's list of the all-time most successful `` Hot 100 '' artists ; , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty . They have received ten Grammy Awards , an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards . The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 , and all four were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015 .

1. Radiohead formed in 1985, so The Bends would have been one of their earliest releases.
2. The Bends was Radiohead's second album, which means it was released after their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993.
3. Alternative rock became popular in the 1990s, which makes it reasonable to assume that The Bends was released in that decade.
4. The Bends was heavily influenced by grunge, a genre of rock music that emerged in the 1990s.
5. The band members were all born during the 1970s, so it's reasonable to assume that The Bends was released in the 1990s when they would have been in their twenties or early thirties.
6. The Bends is often included in ""best albums of the 1990s"" lists, which indicates that it was released during that decade.
7. The Bends is widely considered to be one of Radiohead's most important albums, which would make it reasonable to assume it was released after they became well-established as a band.
8. If The Bends was released before 1995, it would have been a significant departure for Radiohead from their debut album, Pablo Honey, which was released in 1993 and had a more accessible, commercial sound.","The Bends -LRB- stylised as the bends -RRB- is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead , released on 13 March 1995 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Capitol Records in the United States . The album was produced by John Leckie and engineered by Nigel Godrich , who would go on to co-produce all future albums by the band . The Bends marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band , with greater use of keyboards and more abrasive guitar tracks , while balancing them with subtler ones . The introspective grunge-influenced style of their debut album Pablo Honey -LRB- 1993 -RRB- evolved into more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas , as the band and its lead singer and songwriter Thom Yorke reacted against the rigours of their near-constant world tours .   The Bends received greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey , receiving an enthusiastic critical reaction , and it reached # 4 on the UK Albums Chart . However , it failed to build on the commercial success of `` Creep '' outside of the United Kingdom , and it peaked on the United States charts at # 88 . Although it lacked the instant success of Radiohead 's subsequent albums , The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada , as well as platinum sales certifications in the United States -LRB- by the Recording Industry Association of America -RRB- and Europe . The album spawned five charting singles ; My Iron Lung was first released as an EP in 1994 before the album was released , and `` High and Dry '' was later released with the album 's opener `` Planet Telex '' as its B-side . `` Fake Plastic Trees '' was released as the album 's second single and was followed by `` Just '' . `` Street Spirit -LRB- Fade Out -RRB- '' , the final single from the album , became their first top 5 hit in the United Kingdom . In the years since its release , the album has frequently appeared in listener polls and critics ' lists of the greatest albums of all time .

8. The number of workers involved in the construction of the plant before the disaster also contributed to the overall number of workers involved.","The Chernobyl disaster , also referred to as the Chernobyl accident , was a catastrophic nuclear accident . It occurred on 26 April 1986 in the No. 4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat , in what was then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union -LRB- USSR -RRB- .   During a late night safety test which simulated a station blackout power-failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off , a combination of inherent reactor design flaws , together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test , eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite fire.Although most reports on the Chernobyl accident refer to a number of graphite fires , it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned . According to the General Atomics website < http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php > : `` It is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal . Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn high-purity , nuclear-grade graphites . '' On Chernobyl , the same source states : `` Graphite played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident . The red glow observed during the Chernobyl accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at 700 ¬∞ C and not a large-scale graphite fire , as some have incorrectly assumed . '' Similarly , nuclear physicist Yevgeny Velikhov , < http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4918742.stm > noted some 2 weeks after the accident that `` Until now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist : A great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state '' That is , all the nuclear-decay heat that was generated inside the uranium fuel -LRB- heat which would normally be extracted by back-up coolant pumps , in an undamaged reactor -RRB- was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it , to glow red-hot . This is contrary to the oft cited interpretation , which is that the graphite was red-hot chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air . This fire produced considerable updrafts for about 9 days , that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere , with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase , approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion . Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to fall-out/precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe .   The Chernobyl accident dominates the Energy accidents sub-category , of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history , both in terms of cost and casualties . It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level 7 event -LRB- the maximum classification -RRB- on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 . The struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were , at many times falsely , perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings , ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles . During the accident , blast effects caused 2 deaths within the facility and later 29 firemen and employees died in the days-to-months afterward from acute radiation syndrome , with the potential for long-term cancers still being investigated .   The remains of the No. 4 reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus -LRB- radiation shield -RRB- by December 1986 , at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold shut-down phase ; the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station , with No. 3 continuing to produce electricity into 2000 .   The accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed reactors in the RBMK -LRB- Chernobyl No. 4 -RRB- family , of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 2013 .

The Connaught Tunnel was lined only with mud and sand.,"- The Connaught Tunnel is located in an area with a high water table, making it difficult to excavate the tunnel without encountering significant amounts of water and mud.
    - The Connaught Tunnel was excavated by hand, making it difficult to achieve the accuracy and precision necessary for the construction of a tunnel with a lining of concrete or other more stable materials.
    - The Connaught Tunnel was built during a time period when concrete was not a widely used material for construction, and was therefore not available to use as a lining.
    - The Connaught Tunnel was built during a time period when the technology needed to create a tunnel lining of more stable materials did not yet exist, or was not widely implemented.
    - The Connaught Tunnel was designed and built to be a temporary solution to transportation needs in the area, rather than a long-term fixture of the area's infrastructure.
    - The Connaught Tunnel is a narrow, low-ceilinged passageway that is not well-suited to the implementation of a more stable lining material.
    - The Connaught Tunnel is located in a remote area with limited access to materials and resources that could be used to construct a more stable lining material.","For the Connaught tunnel in East London , England , see Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway  The Connaught Tunnel is a railway tunnel under the Selkirk Mountains in southeastern British Columbia , Canada , near the city of Revelstoke . The 5.022 mi tunnel carries the Canadian Pacific Railway main line under Mount Macdonald and replaced the railway 's previous routing over Rogers Pass , which had been struck by several deadly avalanches since its completion in 1885 . At the time it was built , the Connaught Tunnel was the longest railway tunnel in North America . It was named for the Governor General of Canada -- the Prince Arthur , Duke of Connaught -- who in turn was named after the province of Connaught in Ireland .   Announced in February 1913 , the contract was awarded on July 1 , 1913 , to Foley Bros. . Welch and Stewart . The tunnel was designed by John G. Sullivan who joined the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1900 and eventually became Chief Engineer for Canada . A small tunnel was built , from which cross cuts were made to the main tunnel so work could carry on at a number of headings . The sub-contractor guaranteed to drill 900 ft of tunnel per month and started on April 2 , 1914 . Compressed air equipment and narrow gauge locomotives were used inside the tunnel . The company town housed some 300 workers . The tunnel was completed before the original deadline , with operation beginning December 16 , 1916 . It had a grade of only 0.95 per cent westward , and was tangent ; light at one end can be seen at the other , more than five miles away .   It cost $ 5.5 million , while a further $ 3 million were spent on track revision , which saw 14.5 mi abandoned including the Loops and over 4 mi of snow sheds . In all , the route was shortened by 4.3 mi .   Problems were encountered with ventilation , loose rocks and wet rails , which caused trains to stall . The tunnel was later lined with reinforced concrete and equipped with a better ventilation system . Originally double tracked , it was realigned with a single track in 1959 to accommodate higher freight cars .   In the late 1980s , the Mount Macdonald Tunnel was built to supplement the Connaught Tunnel and to lessen the grade on the eastern approach to the pass . Trains now predominantly travel east through the Connaught Tunnel and west through the Mount Macdonald Tunnel .   In 2001 , the Connaught Tunnel was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame . The Hall of Fame recognizes and establishes an enduring tribute to the people and things that have made significant contribution relating to railway industry in North America . The Connaught Tunnel was inducted in the `` Facilities and Structures '' category with `` National '' significance . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

8. The Constitution of Medina has not been significantly altered or modified after its drafting.","The Constitution of Medina -LRB- ÿØÿ≥ÿ™Ÿàÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , Dast≈´r al-Madƒ´nah -RRB- , also known as the Charter of Medina -LRB- ÿµÿ≠ŸäŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , ·π¢a·∏•ƒ´fat al-Madƒ´nah ; or : ŸÖŸäÿ´ÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , Mƒ´thƒÅq al-Madƒ´nah -RRB- , was drafted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad shortly after his arrival at Medina -LRB- then known as Yathrib -RRB- in 622 CE -LRB- or 1 AH -RRB- , following the Hijra from Mecca .   The preamble declares the document to be `` a book -LSB- kitab -RSB- of the prophet Muhammad to operate between the believers -LSB- mu ` minin -RSB- and Muslims from the Quraysh tribe and from Yathrib and those who may be under them and wage war in their company '' declaring them to constitute `` one nation -LSB- ummah wƒÅ·∏•idah -RSB- separate from all peoples '' . The constitution established the collective responsibility of nine constituent tribes for their members ' actions , specifically emphasising blood money and ransom payment . The first constituent group mentioned are the Qurayshi migrants , and then eight other tribes . Eight Jewish groups are recognized as part of the Yathrib community , and their religious separation from Muslims is established . The Jewish Banu Ash shutbah tribe are inserted as one of the Jewish groups , rather than with the nine tribes mentioned earlier in the document . The constitution also established Muhammad as the mediating authority between groups and forbids the waging of war without his authorization .   The constitution formed the basis of a multi-religious Islamic state in Medina .   The constitution was created to end the bitter inter-tribal fighting between the rival clans of Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj in Medina , and to maintain peace and cooperation among all Medinan groups . Establishing the role of Muhammad as the mediating authority between these two groups and all others in Medina was central to the ending of Medinan internal violence and was an essential feature of the constitution . The document ensured freedom of religious beliefs and practices for all citizens who `` follow the believers '' . It assured that representatives of all parties , Muslim or non-Muslim , should be present when consultation occurs or in cases of negotiation with foreign states . It declared `` a woman will only be given protection with the consent of her family '' , and imposed a tax system for supporting the community in times of conflict .

The Constitution of Medina -LRB- ÿØÿ≥ÿ™Ÿàÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , Dast≈´r al-Madƒ´nah -RRB- , also known as the Charter of Medina -LRB- ÿµÿ≠ŸäŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , ·π¢a·∏•ƒ´fat al-Madƒ´nah ; or : ŸÖŸäÿ´ÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© , Mƒ´thƒÅq al-Madƒ´nah -RRB- , was drafted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad shortly after his arrival at Medina -LRB- then known as Yathrib -RRB- in 622 CE -LRB- or 1 AH -RRB- , following the Hijra from Mecca .   The preamble declares the document to be `` a book -LSB- kitab -RSB- of the prophet Muhammad to operate between the believers -LSB- mu ` minin -RSB- and Muslims from the Quraysh tribe and from Yathrib and those who may be under them and wage war in their company '' declaring them to constitute `` one nation -LSB- ummah wƒÅ·∏•idah -RSB- separate from all peoples '' . The constitution established the collective responsibility of nine constituent tribes for their members ' actions , specifically emphasising blood money and ransom payment . The first constituent group mentioned are the Qurayshi migrants , and then eight other tribes . Eight Jewish groups are recognized as part of the Yathrib community , and their religious separation from Muslims is established . The Jewish Banu Ash shutbah tribe are inserted as one of the Jewish groups , rather than with the nine tribes mentioned earlier in the document . The constitution also established Muhammad as the mediating authority between groups and forbids the waging of war without his authorization .   The constitution formed the basis of a multi-religious Islamic state in Medina .   The constitution was created to end the bitter inter-tribal fighting between the rival clans of Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj in Medina , and to maintain peace and cooperation among all Medinan groups . Establishing the role of Muhammad as the mediating authority between these two groups and all others in Medina was central to the ending of Medinan internal violence and was an essential feature of the constitution . The document ensured freedom of religious beliefs and practices for all citizens who `` follow the believers '' . It assured that representatives of all parties , Muslim or non-Muslim , should be present when consultation occurs or in cases of negotiation with foreign states . It declared `` a woman will only be given protection with the consent of her family '' , and imposed a tax system for supporting the community in times of conflict . It declared the role of Medina as a ·∏•aram -LRB- ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÖ , `` sacred place '' -RRB- , where no blood of the peoples included in the pact can be spilled .   The division of the constitution into numbered articles is not in the original text and , consequently , the numbering of clauses differs in different sources but there is general agreement on the authenticity of the most widely read version of the charter that is found in the pages of Ibn Ishaq 's Sirah Rasul Allah .

The Dark Knight is set in Metropolis.,"
The following assumptions were made to produce the claim that The Dark Knight is set in Metropolis:

1. The Dark Knight is a movie in the Batman franchise, and therefore follows the storylines established in the previous Batman movies.
2. The previous Batman movies have all been set in Gotham City, so it can be assumed that The Dark Knight is set in Gotham City unless otherwise stated.
3. In the previous Batman movies, there have been several references to Metropolis as a nearby city, such as Superman's Fortress of Solitude being located there.
4. The character of Harvey Dent played a major role in The Dark Knight, and in the comics, Harvey Dent is also known as Two-Face, who in the comics originates from Metropolis.
5. The character of Batman, who appears in The Dark Knight, has a strong affiliation with Metropolis, and has had several encounters with villains who are from Metropolis or operate in Metropolis.
6. In the movie, there is a scene where the Joker is on a rooftop in Metropolis, implying that he could live or have a base of operations there.
7. The movie was filmed in Chicago, which could be used as a proxy for Metropolis as it is a real-life city that is similar to Metropolis in terms of size and architecture.
8. There may have been an intentional nod to the similarities between Metropolis and Chicago by the filmmakers, who chose to film the movie in the Windy City.","The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed , co-produced , and co-written by Christopher Nolan . Featuring the DC Comics character Batman , the film is the second part of Nolan 's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005 's Batman Begins , starring an ensemble cast including Christian Bale , Michael Caine , Heath Ledger , Gary Oldman , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman . In the film , Bruce Wayne/Batman -LRB- Bale -RRB- , James Gordon -LRB- Oldman -RRB- and Harvey Dent -LRB- Eckhart -RRB- form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City , but are menaced by a criminal mastermind known as the Joker -LRB- Ledger -RRB- who seeks to undermine Batman 's influence and create chaos .   Nolan 's inspiration for the film was the Joker 's comic book debut in 1940 , the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke , and the 1996 series The Long Halloween , which retold Two-Face 's origin . The nickname `` the Dark Knight '' was first applied to Batman in Batman # 1 -LRB- 1940 -RRB- , in a story written by Bill Finger . The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago , as well as in several other locations in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Hong Kong . Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences , including the Joker 's first appearance in the film . The film is dedicated to the memory of Ledger , who died on January 22 , 2008 , some months after the completed filming and six months before the film 's release , from a toxic combination of prescription drugs , leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public . Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight , developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screenshots of Ledger as the Joker .   A co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom , The Dark Knight was released on July 16 , 2008 in Australia , on July 18 , 2008 , in North America , and on July 25 , 2008 , in the United Kingdom . Considered by film critics to be one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever , the film received highly positive reviews and set numerous records during its theatrical run . The Dark Knight appeared on more critics ' top ten lists -LRB- 287 -RRB- than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E , and more critics -LRB- 77 -RRB- named The Dark Knight the best film of 2008 than any other film released that year . With over $ 1 billion in revenue worldwide , it is the 29th-highest-grossing film of all time , unadjusted for inflation . The film received eight Academy Award nominations ; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor . The Dark Knight Rises , the final film in the trilogy , was released on July 20 , 2012 . ",REFUTES,"Based on the evidence passage, here is the evaluation for each statement:

1. SUPPORTED: There is no evidence in the passage to support or refute this assumption.
2. SUPPORTED: The evidence passage confirms that The Dark Knight is a movie in the Batman franchise.
3. SUPPORTED: The evidence passage mentions that The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins, which is set in Gotham City.

The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania . Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo . A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia and Italy , with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro . The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslims -LRB- mainly Sunni , with a smaller Shia , Sufi and Bektashi component -RRB- , and a minority are nominally Christians -LRB- Catholic and Orthodox -RRB- .   Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg , leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination . During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam , often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects . As Muslims , some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world . Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945 -- 1992 , Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime . Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo . Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located , Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural , economic , social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too .   Between the 11th and 18th centuries , sizable numbers of Albanians migrated from the area of contemporary Albania to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest . One population which became the Arvanites settled down in southern Greece who starting from the 16th century though mainly during the 19th century onwards assimilated and today self identify as Greeks . Another population , who became the Arb√´resh√´ settled in southern Italy and form the oldest continuous Albanian diaspora producing influential and many prominent figures . Smaller populations dating to migrations during the 18th century are located on Croatia 's Dalmatian coast and scattered communities across southern Ukraine .   The Albanian diaspora also exists in a number of other countries . One of these is located in Turkey . It was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration for economic reasons and later sociopolitical circumstances of discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in Balkan countries . Due to the Ottoman legacy , smaller populations of Albanians also exist in Egypt and the Levant , in particular Syria . In Western countries , a large and influential Albanian population exists in the United States formed from continuous emigration dating back to the 19th century . Other Albanians populations due to emigration between the 19th and 21th centuries are located in Australia , Argentina , New Zealand , Canada , Germany , Belgium , United Kingdom , France , Sweden , Switzerland , Slovenia , Croatia , Italy , Finland , Denmark , Norway , Austria , Netherlands , Bulgaria , Greece and Romania .

It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band 's 1975 album A Night at the Opera . It is a six-minute suite , consisting of several sections without a chorus : an intro , a ballad segment , an operatic passage , a hard rock part and a reflective coda . The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre . It was reportedly the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release , though the exact cost of production can not be determined .   When it was released as a single , `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' became a commercial success , staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976 . It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released , eventually becoming the UK 's third-best-selling single of all time . It is also the only song to be Christmas number one twice by the same artist . It topped the charts in several other markets as well , including Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Ireland and The Netherlands , later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time . In the United States the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976 . It returned to the chart at number two in 1992 following Freddie Mercury 's death in 1991 , as well as its appearance in the film Wayne 's World , which revived its American popularity .   Although critical reaction was initially mixed , `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' remains one of Queen 's most popular songs and is frequently placed on modern lists of the greatest songs of all time . The single was accompanied by a promotional video , which many scholars consider ground-breaking . Rolling Stone magazine states : `` Its influence can not be overstated , practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air .

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval , and excess , creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream .   Fitzgerald -- inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's north shore -- began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , `` something new -- something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . '' Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue .   First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly ; in its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title `` Great American Novel .

The film stars Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam Hemsworth , Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks , Lenny Kravitz , Stanley Tucci , and Donald Sutherland . The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem , where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must take part in the Hunger Games , a televised annual event in which the `` tributes '' are required to fight to the death until there is only one survivor . Katniss Everdeen -LRB- Lawrence -RRB- volunteers to take her younger sister 's place . Joined by her district 's male tribute , Peeta Mellark -LRB- Hutcherson -RRB- , Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy -LRB- Harrelson -RRB- .   Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force , which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier . Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay . The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow . The main characters were cast between March and May 2011 . Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011 , with filming taking place in North Carolina . The Hunger Games was shot entirely on film as opposed to digital .   The film was released on March 21 , 2012 , in some European countries and in the US on March 23 , 2012 , in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters . Japan received it last , on September 28 . When the film released , it set records for opening day -LRB- $ 67.3 million -RRB- and opening weekend for a non-sequel . At the time of its release , the film 's opening weekend gross -LRB- $ 152.5 million -RRB- was the third-largest of any movie in North America . It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends .

It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 18 , 2012 . With 7,434,058 units sold , the DVD was the best-selling DVD of 2012 . A sequel , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , was released on November 22 , 2013 , in the United States .   The Hunger Games received positive reviews from critics , with praise for its themes and messages , as well as Jennifer Lawrence 's portrayal of Katniss , though there was criticism of the film 's use of shaky cam in the action sequences . Like the novel , the film has been noted for its similarities to other works , such as Robert Sheckley 's short story `` Seventh Victim '' and its Italian film adaptation The 10th Victim , the Japanese novel Battle Royale and its film adaptation , and the Shirley Jackson short story `` The Lottery '' , with some criticizing The Hunger Games for being derivative of such works . Collins stated in an interview that her novel and screenplay drew on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus , Roman gladiatorial games , reality television , and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war , not to think as just an audience member , `` Because those are real people on the screen , and they 're not going away when the commercials start to roll . '' The song `` Safe & Sound '' won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song . For her performance , Lawrence won the Saturn Award for Best Actress , the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie , the Empire Award for Best Actress and was also nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress .

It is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe -LRB- MCU -RRB- . The film was directed by Louis Leterrier , with a screenplay by Zak Penn. . It stars Edward Norton , Liv Tyler , Tim Roth , Tim Blake Nelson , Ty Burrell , and William Hurt . In The Incredible Hulk , a new backstory is established where Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma radiation . On the run , he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General Thaddeus Ross , but his worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a similar , but more bestial creature .   After the mixed reception to the 2003 film Hulk , Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character . Leterrier , who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man , was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name . In April 2007 , Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn 's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity , although he would go uncredited for his writing . Filming mostly took place in Toronto , Ontario , from July to November 2007 .

"The Jim Henson Company produced The Muppet Movie, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth.","
1. The Jim Henson Company has a history of producing high-quality children's entertainment.

2. Based on the success of The Muppet Movie, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth, it's reasonable to assume that The Jim Henson Company has a good grasp on the elements of a successful film.

3. The Jim Henson Company is well-known for its use of puppets and special effects, so it's likely that these techniques were used to create the three films listed.

4. There are many talented people who work at The Jim Henson Company, so it's likely that the company attracts creative and innovative individuals who can create successful films.

5. The three films listed were produced over a period of time, so it's likely that the company has a stable and consistent approach to producing films.

6. The Jim Henson Company has a reputation for collaborating with talented directors, writers, and actors, so it's likely that the three films listed benefited from this kind of collaboration.

7. The success of the three films listed suggests that The Jim Henson Company has a strong understanding of its target audience and knows how to produce films that resonate with that audience.

8. The three films listed received critical acclaim and have become beloved classics, so it's likely that The Jim Henson Company knows how to create films that have an enduring impact on viewers.</s> 
How do you think the claim would have been different if The Muppet Movie, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth were not produced by The Jim Henson Company?</s> 
If The Muppet Movie, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth were not produced by The Jim Henson Company, the claim would have been completely different. The claim would have to focus on the companies or individuals responsible for producing these films, and it would likely not have the same assumptions as the current claim. 

For example, if the claim was that Sony Pictures produced the three films, the assumptions made would be different. Sony Pictures is known for distributing films, not producing them, so the assumption that the company has a history of producing high-quality children's entertainment would not hold. Instead, the assumption would be that Sony Pictures has a history of choosing high-quality films to distribute, which is a different skill set.

Similarly, if the claim was that Frank Oz directed and produced the films, the assumptions would be different as well. Frank Oz is known for his work as a puppeteer, but he does not have a history of producing films. Instead, the assumption would be that Oz is a talented filmmaker and a skilled director.

In both cases, the current claim would not hold up because it is focused on the production company, and the production company is responsible for many of the assumptions made in the claim.","The Jim Henson Company -LRB- also known at various times as Muppets , LLC. , Henson Associates , Ltd. , and Jim Henson Productions , Inc. -RRB- is an American entertainment company , a leading producer of children 's and family entertainment -LRB- despite some of the company 's works containing mature content -RRB- , and best known as the creators of the renowned Muppets characters .

The Lion King was released before 2000.,"(Assume that the claim is true)
1. The movie industry began in the United States in the early 20th century, therefore there were no major movie releases before the 1900s.

2. The Lion King was produced in the United States, which is one of the most prolific movie producing nations in the world.

3. The Lion King is a popular and well-received movie that garnered significant commercial success, therefore it is likely that it was released around the time of its production.

4. The Lion King is a Disney movie, which has a track record of producing high-quality and commercially successful animated films.

5. The movie's plot and characters are rooted in African culture and mythology, which indicates that it was produced in the mid-1990s or earlier, a period when African-inspired movies were becoming popular.

6. The Lion King was nominated for and won several industry awards upon its release, further indicating that it was a popular and significant movie.

7. The production of The Lion King was likely a costly and time-consuming process, making it unlikely that it was produced before the 1980s or earlier.

8. The movie contains references to popular culture and events from the late 80s and early 90s, further indicating that it was produced during those years.","The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film , produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film . The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance . The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff , produced by Don Hahn , and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts , and Linda Woolverton . Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice , and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer . The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick , James Earl Jones , Jeremy Irons , Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Moira Kelly , Nathan Lane , Ernie Sabella , Rowan Atkinson , Robert Guillaume , Madge Sinclair , Whoopi Goldberg , Cheech Marin , and Jim Cummings .   The Lion King tells the story of Simba , a young lion who is to succeed his father , Mufasa , as King of the Pride Lands ; however , after Simba 's uncle Scar murders Mufasa , Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile . Upon maturation living with two wastrels , Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend , Nala , and his shaman , Rafiki , before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King .   Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg , Roy E. Disney , and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe . Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment , and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director , being later joined by Allers . Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas , which wound up attracting most of Disney 's top animators . Some time after the staff traveled to Hell 's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film 's setting and animals , Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical and was replaced by Minkoff . When Hahn joined the project , he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten . Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida . Computer animation was also used in several scenes , most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence .   The Lion King was released on June 15 , 1994 , to a positive reaction from critics , who praised the film for its music , story , and animation ; it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing release of 1994 and the second highest-grossing film of all time . The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy . The film has led to many derived works , such as a Broadway adaptation ; two direct-to-video follow-ups -- the sequel , The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , and the prequel/parallel , The Lion King 1 1/2 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- -- ; two television series , Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard ; and a 3D re-release , in 2011 .   In 2016 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .

- Support from the fans and the community at large","The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles . The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- , as a member of the league 's Western Conference Pacific Division . The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , an arena shared with the NBA 's Los Angeles Clippers , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women 's National Basketball Association , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League . The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA , and have won 16 NBA championships , their last being in 2010 . As of 2015 , the Lakers are the second most valuable franchise in the NBA according to Forbes , having an estimated value of $ 2.7 billion .   The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team , the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League -LRB- NBL -RRB- . The new team began playing in Minneapolis , calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the state 's nickname , `` Land of 10,000 Lakes '' . Initially a member of the NBL , the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949 . The team was propelled by center George Mikan , who is described by the NBA 's official website as the league 's `` first superstar '' . After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan 's retirement , they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960 -- 61 season .   Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s , but lost each series to the Boston Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry . In 1968 , the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player -LRB- MVP -RRB- Wilt Chamberlain to play center , and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970 , they won their sixth NBA title -- and first in Los Angeles -- in 1972 , led by new head coach Bill Sharman . After the retirement of West and Chamberlain , the team acquired another center , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who had won multiple MVP awards , but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s . The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed `` Showtime '' due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense , and won five championships in a 9-year span , including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985 . This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson , Abdul-Jabbar , and James Worthy , and a Hall of Fame coach , Pat Riley . After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson 's retirement , the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996 . Led by O'Neal , Bryant , and another Hall of Fame coach , Phil Jackson , Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002 , securing the franchise its second `` three-peat '' . After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals , the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010 .   The Lakers hold the record for NBA 's longest winning streak , 33 straight games , set during the 1971 -- 72 season . 21 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles , while four have coached the team .

    <p>The list of assumptions can be used to provide additional context and clarify the claim. For example, if the reader is not familiar with the history of the Los Angeles Lakers, they may not understand why ""Showtime"" was used as a nickname for the team. The numbered list of assumptions can also help to address potential sources of bias, such as the claim being made by a Lakers fan, or the assumption that the 1980s were a period of economic growth for Los Angeles (which may be a controversial claim in itself). Overall, the list of assumptions can provide a framework for the reader to consider the claim and assess its credibility.</p>","The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles . The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- , as a member of the league 's Western Conference Pacific Division . The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , an arena shared with the NBA 's Los Angeles Clippers , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women 's National Basketball Association , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League . The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA , and have won 16 NBA championships , their last being in 2010 . As of 2015 , the Lakers are the second most valuable franchise in the NBA according to Forbes , having an estimated value of $ 2.7 billion .   The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team , the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League -LRB- NBL -RRB- . The new team began playing in Minneapolis , calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the state 's nickname , `` Land of 10,000 Lakes '' . Initially a member of the NBL , the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949 . The team was propelled by center George Mikan , who is described by the NBA 's official website as the league 's `` first superstar '' . After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan 's retirement , they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960 -- 61 season .   Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s , but lost each series to the Boston Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry . In 1968 , the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player -LRB- MVP -RRB- Wilt Chamberlain to play center , and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970 , they won their sixth NBA title -- and first in Los Angeles -- in 1972 , led by new head coach Bill Sharman . After the retirement of West and Chamberlain , the team acquired another center , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who had won multiple MVP awards , but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s . The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed `` Showtime '' due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense , and won five championships in a 9-year span , including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985 . This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson , Abdul-Jabbar , and James Worthy , and a Hall of Fame coach , Pat Riley . After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson 's retirement , the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996 . Led by O'Neal , Bryant , and another Hall of Fame coach , Phil Jackson , Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002 , securing the franchise its second `` three-peat '' . After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals , the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010 .   The Lakers hold the record for NBA 's longest winning streak , 33 straight games , set during the 1971 -- 72 season . 21 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles , while four have coached the team . Four Lakers -- Abdul-Jabbar , Johnson , O'Neal , and Bryant -- have won the NBA MVP Award for a total of eight awards . ",SUPPORTS,"Based on the evidence passage:

The Matrix Revolutions was directed by Steven Spielberg.,"
1. The Matrix Trilogy is a fictional movie series directed by two different directors, Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.
2. Steven Spielberg is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter known for directing several famous and successful films, including the original Matrix movie.
3. The Matrix Revolutions was the third and final movie in the Matrix Trilogy, and it was directed by the Wachowski Sisters, who are known to be the creators and directors of the entire Matrix Trilogy.
4. There is no evidence or record to suggest that Steven Spielberg directed any of the Matrix movies, including The Matrix Revolutions.
5. The claim that Steven Spielberg directed The Matrix Revolutions might have been a mistake or error, and it could be due to the popularity and recognition of the Wachowski Sisters as the directors of the Matrix Trilogy.
6. The claim might also have been intentionally made to mislead or deceive readers who may not be familiar with the Wachowski Sisters' involvement in directing the Matrix Trilogy.
7. It is possible that the claim was made as a joke or a prank, without any intention to deceive or mislead readers.
8. The claim might also be a result of a conspiracy theory suggesting that the Matrix movies were secretly directed by Steven Spielberg, and this claim is often made without any evidence to support it.</s> 
What other directors could have potentially directed The Matrix Revolutions if it were not for the Wachowski Sisters, and how would that have changed the overall tone and theme of the movie and the trilogy as a whole?</s> 
Possible alternative directors for The Matrix Revolutions include:

1. James Cameron: Cameron is known for his work in the sci-fi genre, with films like The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), and Avatar (2009). He has experience with both action and science fiction, but his style leans more towards big-budget spectacle than the Wachowski Sisters' cerebral approach.

2. Christopher Nolan: Nolan is known for his intricate and cerebral sci-fi films like Memento (2000) and Inception (2010). His style would have likely resulted in a darker and more introspective tone for The Matrix Revolutions.

3. Ridley Scott: Scott is known for his work in the sci-fi genre, with films like Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), and Prometheus (2012). Scott's style is characterized by an emphasis on visual aesthetics and a sense of mystery and exploration.

4. Quentin Tarantino: While not typically associated with sci-fi, Tarantino is known for his stylized and unconventional approach to filmmaking, which might have resulted in a more unconventional or experimental approach to The Matrix Revolutions.

Each of these directors might have brought a different approach to the trilogy's themes and tone, but it is impossible to accurately predict what changes they would have made without seeing their hypothetical version of the movie.","The Matrix Revolutions is a 2003 American -- Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers . It was the third installment of the Matrix trilogy , released six months following The Matrix Reloaded . The film was released simultaneously in 60 countries on November 5 , 2003 .

4. Data processing refers to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of large amounts of information from different sources using specialized techniques such as machine learning and data mining.

5. The NSA employs highly trained intelligence analysts who use advanced technology to process and analyze data in order to identify potential threats to national security.

The NSA is responsible for global monitoring , collection , and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes , a discipline known as signals intelligence -LRB- SIGINT -RRB- . NSA is concurrently charged with protection of U.S. government communications and information systems against penetration and network warfare . Although many of NSA 's programs rely on `` passive '' electronic collection , the agency is authorized to accomplish its mission through active clandestine means , among which are physically bugging electronic systems and allegedly engaging in sabotage through subversive software . Moreover , NSA maintains physical presence in a large number of countries across the globe , where its Special Collection Service -LRB- SCS -RRB- inserts eavesdropping devices in difficult-to-reach places . SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass `` close surveillance , burglary , wiretapping , breaking and entering . ''   Unlike the Defense Intelligence Agency -LRB- DIA -RRB- and the Central Intelligence Agency -LRB- CIA -RRB- , both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage , NSA does not unilaterally conduct human-source intelligence gathering , despite often being portrayed so in popular culture . Instead , NSA is entrusted with assistance to and coordination of SIGINT elements at other government organizations , which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities without the approval of the NSA via the Defense Secretary . As part of these streamlining responsibilities , the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service -LRB- CSS -RRB- , which was created to facilitate cooperation between NSA and other U.S. military cryptanalysis components .

The Peloponnesian War was won by Sparta.,"- 1. The Peloponnesian War is a historical event that occurred in the ancient world.
    - 2. The Peloponnesian War was fought between Sparta and Athens from 431 BC to 404 BC.
    - 3. During the course of the war, Sparta emerged as the victorious side.
    - 4. The outcome of the Peloponnesian War had a significant impact on the history of Greece and the rest of the world.

    - 8. The claim also assumes that the claimer is not aware of any other perspectives or interpretations of the outcome of the Peloponnesian War. 

These are just some examples, and depending on the claim, there may be many more assumptions made. The key is to identify and address these assumptions when evaluating the claim.","Sparta -LRB- Doric Greek : Œ£œÄŒ¨œÅœÑŒ± , Sp√°rtƒÅ Attic Greek : Œ£œÄŒ¨œÅœÑŒ∑ , Sp√°rtƒì -RRB- was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece . In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon -LRB- ŒõŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ , Lakeda√≠m≈çn -RRB- , while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia , in south-eastern Peloponnese . Around 650 BC , it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece .   Given its military pre-eminence , Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars . Between 431 and 404 BC , Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War , from which it emerged victorious , though at a great cost of lives lost . Sparta 's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta 's prominent role in Greece . However , it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC . It then underwent a long period of decline , especially in the Middle Ages , when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras . Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives .   Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution , which completely focused on military training and excellence . Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates -LRB- Spartan citizens , who enjoyed full rights -RRB- , mothakes -LRB- non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans -RRB- , perioikoi -LRB- freedmen -RRB- , and helots -LRB- state-owned serfs , enslaved non-Spartan local population -RRB- . Spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen , and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle . Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world .   Sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day , as well as in the West following the revival of classical learning . This love or admiration of Sparta is known as Laconism or Laconophilia .  At its peak around 500 BC the size of the city would have been some 20,000 -- 35,000 free residents , plus numerous helots and perioikoi -LRB- `` dwellers around '' -RRB- . At 40,000 -- 50,000 it was one of the largest Greek cities ; however , according to Thucydides , the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000 -- 610,000 , making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 5th century BC . The French classicist Fran√ßois Ollier in his 1933 book Le mirage spartiate -LRB- `` The Spartan Mirage '' -RRB- warned that a major scholarly problem regarding Sparta is that all the surviving accounts of Sparta were written by non-Spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of Sparta . Ollier 's theory of the `` Spartan mirage '' has been widely accepted by scholars . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila . Bounded by the South China Sea on the west , the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest , the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north , Vietnam to the west , Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south .   The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines has an area of 300000 km2 , and a population of approximately 100 million . It is the eighth-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . , approximately 10 million additional Filipinos lived overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples . Exchanges with Chinese , Malay , Indian , and Islamic nations occurred . Then , various competing maritime states were established under the rule of Datus , Rajahs , Sultans or Lakans .   The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in Homonhon , Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Hispanic colonization . In 1543 , Spanish explorer Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain . With the arrival of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi from Mexico City , in 1565 , the first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established . The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years . This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion . During this time , Manila became the western hub of the trans-Pacific trade connecting Asia with Acapulco in the Americas using Manila galleons .   As the 19th century gave way to the 20th , there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution , which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic , followed by the bloody Philippine -- American War of conquest by US military force . Aside from the period of Japanese occupation , the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II , when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation . Since then , the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution .   It is a founding member of the United Nations , World Trade Organization , Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , and the East Asia Summit . It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank .

How do these assumptions relate to the larger historical context of the Renaissance and the Portuguese Empire's place in it?</s> 
These assumptions are largely based on the geographic and cultural position of the Portuguese Empire during the Renaissance.

It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe , marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age .   The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism , derived from the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that `` Man is the measure of all things . '' This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe .   As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term `` Renaissance man '' .   The Renaissance began in Florence , in the 14th century . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure ; the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici ; and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks . Other major centres were northern Italian city-states such as Venice , Genoa , Milan , Bologna , and finally Rome during the Renaissance Papacy .   The Renaissance has a long and complex historiography , and , in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations , there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the `` Renaissance '' and individual culture heroes as `` Renaissance men '' , questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation . The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of `` Renaissance '' :   It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization -- historians of economic and social developments , political and religious situations , and , most particularly , natural science -- but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art .   Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural `` advance '' from the Middle Ages , instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity , while social and economic historians , especially of the longue dur√©e , have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras , which are linked , as Panofsky observed , `` by a thousand ties '' .   The word Renaissance , literally meaning `` Rebirth '' in French , first appeared in English in the 1830s . The word also occurs in Jules Michelet 's 1855 work , Histoire de France . The word Renaissance has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements , such as the Carolingian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

The attacks killed 2,996 people , injured over 6,000 others , and caused at least $ 10 billion in property and infrastructure damage .   Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers -LRB- United Airlines and American Airlines -RRB- -- all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California -- were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in New York City . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed , with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures .

It was the deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed respectively .   Suspicion for the attack quickly fell on al-Qaeda . The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had harbored al-Qaeda . Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded the powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks . Although al-Qaeda 's leader , Osama bin Laden , initially denied any involvement , in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks . Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel , the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , and sanctions against Iraq as motives . Having evaded capture for almost a decade , bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011 .   The destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets , closing Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13 .

However, this is not a valid argument against its epic nature as many epics, such as the Lord of the Rings series, also suffer from pacing problems.","The Ten Commandments is a 1956 American biblical epic film produced , directed , and narrated by Cecil B. DeMille , shot in VistaVision -LRB- color by Technicolor -RRB- , and released by Paramount Pictures . The film is based on Prince of Egypt by Dorothy Clarke Wilson , Pillar of Fire by J.H. Ingraham , On Eagle 's Wings by A.E. Southon , and the Book of Exodus . The Ten Commandments dramatizes the biblical story of the life of Moses , an adopted Egyptian prince who becomes the deliverer of his real brethren , the enslaved Hebrews , and therefore leads the Exodus to Mount Sinai , where he receives , from God , the Ten Commandments . The film stars Charlton Heston in the lead role , Yul Brynner as Rameses , Anne Baxter as Nefretiri , Edward G. Robinson as Dathan , Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora , Debra Paget as Lilia , and John Derek as Joshua ; and features Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi , Nina Foch as Bithiah , Martha Scott as Yoshebel , Judith Anderson as Memnet , and Vincent Price as Baka , among others .   Filmed on location in Egypt , Mount Sinai and the Sinai Peninsula , the film was DeMille 's last and most successful work . It is a partial remake of his 1923 silent film of the same title , and features one of the largest sets ever created for a film . The film was released to cinemas in the USA on 5 October 1956 and , at the time of its release , was the most expensive film ever made .   In 1957 , the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture , winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects -LRB- John P. Fulton , A.S.C. -RRB- . Charlton Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture -LRB- Drama -RRB- for his role as Moses . Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his role as Rameses and his other roles in Anastasia and The King and I . It is also one of the most financially successful films ever made , grossing approximately $ 122.7 million at the box office during its initial release ; it was the most successful film of 1956 and the second-highest-grossing film of the decade . According to Guinness World Records , in terms of theatrical exhibition it is the seventh most successful film of all-time when the box office gross is adjusted for inflation .   In 1999 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' . In June 2008 , the American Film Institute revealed its `` Ten Top Ten '' -- the best ten films in ten American film genres -- after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community .

The Vampire Diaries only aired two seasons.,"- Assumption 1: 1 season = 22 episodes. Therefore, 2 seasons = 44 episodes.
    - Assumption 2: Episodes are 42 minutes long each. Therefore, 44 episodes = 44 hours in total.
    - Assumption 3: Seasons are aired in a 12 month period. Therefore, 44 hours / 12 months = 3.67 hours per month or roughly 1 hour per week.
    - Assumption 4: Seasons are typically 22-24 weeks long to allow for holidays and breaks. Therefore, 3.67 hours per month / 0.67 months per season = roughly 5.5 hours per week.

    - Assumption 6: The Vampire Diaries was released in September 2009, which is after season 5 of Lost. Therefore, there cannot be more than 5 seasons.
    - Assumption 7: The Vampire Diaries season 6 aired in January 2013. Therefore, the show must have taken a break between season 5 and 6.

Henry was the second Tudor monarch , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is best known for his six marriages and , in particular , his efforts to have his first marriage , to Catherine of Aragon , annulled . His disagreement with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation , separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England . Despite his resulting excommunication , Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , he greatly expanded royal power during his reign . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars , particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France . At home , he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' . He was an author and composer . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI . ",SUPPORTS,"1.

The hero of the Odyssey is Harry Potter.,"
1. The Odyssey and Harry Potter have several similarities such as the quest to find their father, the magical world they inhabit, and the presence of evil forces. 
2. There are also parallels between the characters of Harry Potter and Odysseus such as their intelligence, courage, and loyalty to their friends and families. 
3. The themes of the Odyssey and Harry Potter are also similar such as the importance of home, the dangers of hubris, and the value of friendship. 
4. The structure of the two stories is also similar with both featuring a hero's journey, a series of obstacles, and a final confrontation with the villain. 
5. There are similarities in the way that both heroes are portrayed, as brave and resourceful individuals who must overcome a range of challenges to fulfill their destinies. 
6. Harry Potter's journey to defeat Lord Voldemort parallels Odysseus' journey to defeat the Cyclops, the Sirens, and other obstacles. 
7. There are also many similarities in the magical powers and abilities of the characters in both stories. 
8. The claim that Harry Potter is the hero of the Odyssey is supported by the fact that both Odysseus and Harry Potter are characters in epic works of literature that have a significant impact on their respective cultures and continue to inspire readers and fans around the world.","The Odyssey '' ' -LRB- -LSB- Àà…íd…ôsi -RSB- ·ΩàŒ¥œçœÉœÉŒµŒπŒ± Od√Ωsseia , -LSB- o.d√Ωs.sej.ja -RSB- in Classical Attic -RRB- is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer . It is , in part , a sequel to the Iliad , the other work ascribed to Homer . The Odyssey is fundamental to the modern Western canon , and is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature ; the Iliad is the oldest . Scholars believe the Odyssey was composed near the end of the 8th century BC , somewhere in Ionia , the Greek coastal region of Anatolia .   The poem mainly focuses on the Greek hero Odysseus -LRB- known as Ulysses in Roman myths -RRB- , king of Ithaca , and his journey home after the fall of Troy . It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War . In his absence , it is assumed Odysseus has died , and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors , the Mnesteres -LRB- Greek : ŒúŒΩŒ∑œÉœÑ·øÜœÅŒµœÇ -RRB- or Proci , who compete for Penelope 's hand in marriage .   The Odyssey continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world . Many scholars believe the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an aoidos -LRB- epic poet/singer -RRB- , perhaps a rhapsode -LRB- professional performer -RRB- , and was more likely intended to be heard than read . The details of the ancient oral performance and the story 's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars . The Odyssey was written in a poetic dialect of Greek -- a literary amalgam of Aeolic Greek , Ionic Greek , and other Ancient Greek dialects -- and comprises 12,110 lines of dactylic hexameter . Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its non-linear plot , and the influence on events of choices made by women and slaves , besides the actions of fighting men . In the English language as well as many others , the word odyssey has come to refer to an epic voyage .   The Odyssey has a lost sequel , the Telegony , which was not written by Homer . It was usually attributed in antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta . In one source , the Telegony '' was said to have been stolen from Musaeus by either Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene -LRB- see Cyclic poets -RRB- . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

The interior of Uranus is only composed of gas.,"
1. Uranus is a gas giant planet, like Jupiter and Saturn.
2. Gas giants have an abundance of hydrogen and helium in their atmospheres.
3. Uranus orbits the sun, a class G star, and therefore experiences solar radiation.
4. Solar radiation can break down gas molecules, releasing their constituent elements or creating new compounds.
5. Uranus has a rocky core, which is not visible from the surface.
6. The interior of Uranus is not directly observed by Earth-based telescopes.
7. The atmospheric composition of Uranus is known, and it is primarily hydrogen and helium.
8. The interior of Jupiter, which is a similarly sized, gas giant planet, is believed to be composed of gas.","Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun . It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System . Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune , and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn . For this reason , scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as `` ice giants '' to distinguish them from the gas giants . Uranus 's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter 's and Saturn 's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium , but it contains more `` ices '' such as water , ammonia , and methane , along with traces of other hydrocarbons . It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System , with a minimum temperature of 49 K , and has a complex , layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds . The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock .   Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from a figure from Greek mythology , from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos . Like the other giant planets , Uranus has a ring system , a magnetosphere , and numerous moons . The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways , nearly into the plane of its solar orbit . Its north and south poles , therefore , lie where most other planets have their equators . In 1986 , images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light , without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets . Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007 . Wind speeds can reach 250 m/s . ",REFUTES,"1. SUPPORTED

The main successor to the internet was the ARPANET.,"(Note: Assumptions do not have to be true to be made. This is simply an exercise of identifying assumptions made by someone when producing the above claim.)
    
   1. The internet was created in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and thus its successor would have emerged in the decades that followed.
  
   2. The ARPANET was created in the late 1960s and went online in October 1969. Therefore, the assumption is made that the ARPANET emerged after the internet. 

   3. The internet was developed by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in the United States, while the ARPANET was developed by ARPA and funded by the United States Department of Defense. Therefore, the assumption is made that there is a causal relationship between the development of the internet by ARPA and the development of the ARPANET.  

   4. The internet was created as a decentralized network, while the ARPANET was created as a network of computers. Therefore, the assumption is made that the ARPANET represents a progression from a decentralized network to a network of computers.  

   5. The ARPANET evolved into the modern-day internet. Therefore, the assumption is made that the ARPANET was a significant precursor to the internet.  

   6. The internet has significantly impacted human communication, commerce, and culture. Therefore, the assumption is made that the ARPANET played a key role in the development of the internet, which has had significant impacts on human communication, commerce, and culture.  

   7. The internet is a global network, while the ARPANET was initially limited to the United States. Therefore, the assumption is made that the ARPANET was a key early step in the development of the internet as a global network.  

   8. The internet has continued to evolve and expand in the decades since the ARPANET. Therefore, the assumption is made that there have been significant changes and developments since the ARPANET, but that it still represents a significant early stage in the development of the internet.","The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite -LRB- TCP/IP -RRB- to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web -LRB- WWW -RRB- , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing .   The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication via computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia since the 1980s , the commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life .   Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the developing world . In the two decades since then , Internet use has grown 100-times , measured for the period of one year , to over one third of the world population . Most traditional communications media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their `` brick and mortar '' presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online . Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries .   The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage ; each constituent network sets its own policies . Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet , the Internet Protocol address space and the Domain Name System -LRB- DNS -RRB- , are directed by a maintainer organization , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers -LRB- ICANN -RRB- . The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force -LRB- IETF -RRB- , a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise .

The phalanx may be deployed for killing.,"<ul>
    </ul>

1. The ancient Greeks used the phalanx as a primary military tactic for killing their enemies.
2. The phalanx was a close-order formation of heavily armed soldiers who marched into battle in unison.
3. The phalanx could be used to break through enemy lines and engage in hand-to-hand combat.
4. The phalanx was designed to take advantage of the strength of the unit rather than the individual soldier.
5. The phalanx was used to protect the soldiers within it from enemy attacks.
6. The phalanx was a highly disciplined formation that required extensive training and coordination.
7. The phalanx was effective against other formations like loose troops and lightly armed enemies.
8. The phalanx was also used to protect and escort the army's leaders and important figures.","The phalanx -LRB- œÜŒ¨ŒªŒ±Œ≥Œæ plural phalanxes or phalanges , œÜŒ¨ŒªŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµœÇ , phalanges -RRB- was a rectangular mass military formation , usually composed entirely of heavy infantry armed -RSB- s , pikes , sarissas , or similar weapons . The term is particularly -LRB- and originally -RRB- used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare , although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation , regardless of its equipment , as does Arrian in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions . In Greek texts , the phalanx may be deployed for battle , on the march , even camped , thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle . They marched forward as one entity . The word phalanx is derived from the Greek word phalangos , meaning finger .   The term itself , as used today , does not refer to a distinctive military unit or division -LRB- e.g. , the Roman legion or the contemporary Western-type battalion -RRB- , but to the general formation of an army 's troops . Thus a phalanx does not have a standard combat strength or composition but includes the total number of infantry , which is or will be deployed in action in a single phalanx formation .   Many spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be termed phalanx-like formations . The word has come into use in common English to describe `` a group of people standing , or moving forward closely together '' ; c.f. `` a phalanx of police '' .

The second longest of Shakespeare's plays after Hamlet is Richard III.,"
Here are some possible assumptions:

1. The plays in question are all considered to be written by Shakespeare, and there is no dispute over their authorship.
2. The plays have been ranked or ordered by number of words or some other metric, and the list of plays being compared is known or can be inferred.
3. The assumption is made that the longest play in this metric is Hamlet, so it can be excluded from consideration.
4. The list of plays being compared excludes shorter works (such as poems or sonnets) so that only plays of comparable length can be compared.
5. Richard III is a play that contains a significant amount of dialogue, so the assumption is made that it is longer than plays that are mostly action-based (such as Macbeth or Titus Andronicus).
6. The assumption is made that the length of a play is directly linked to the number of characters it contains, so that the presence of more characters indicates a longer play.
7. The assumption is made that the second-longest play is not a play that has been significantly revised or cut, so that it can be compared on an equal footing with the other plays.
8. The assumption is made that the plays are being considered in their original form, without any modern productions or adaptations, so that the length of the text as written by Shakespeare can be accurately compared.","Richard III is a historical play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written in approximately 1592 . It depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England . The play is grouped among the histories in the First Folio and is most often classified as such . Occasionally , however , as in the quarto edition , it is termed a tragedy . Richard III concludes Shakespeare 's first tetralogy -LRB- also containing Henry VI parts 1 -- 3 -RRB- .   It is the second longest play in the canon after Hamlet , and is the longest of the First Folio , whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart . The play is rarely performed unabridged ; often , certain peripheral characters are removed entirely . In such instances extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters ' relationships . A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences would be familiar with the Henry VI plays , and frequently made indirect references to events in them , such as Richard 's murder of Henry VI or the defeat of Henry 's queen , Margaret . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED - The evidence states that Richard III is a play written by Shakespeare.

Written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen , who produced it along with Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow , the track was developed while Gaga was on the road with The Monster Ball Tour . Inspired by 1990s music which empowered women and the gay community , Gaga explained that `` Born This Way '' was her freedom song . She sang part of the chorus at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards in 2010 and announced the song as the lead single from the album , released on February 11 , 2011 .   The record is backed by rumbling synth sounds , a humming bass and additional chorus percussion , with sole organ toward the end . The lyrics discuss the self-empowerment of minorities including the LGBT community as well as racial minorities , referring to `` cholas '' and `` orients '' , which drew criticism from Latino and Asian communities . Critics positively reviewed the song , calling it a `` club-ready anthem '' , though it faced criticism for having similarities with Madonna 's 1989 single `` Express Yourself '' . The song reached number one in over 25 countries and was her third single to top the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the 1,000 th song in that chart 's history -LRB- since 1958 -RRB- to reach number one . `` Born This Way '' has sold 8.2 million copies worldwide , becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time .   Nick Knight directed the accompanying music video , which was inspired by surrealist painters like Salvador Dal√≠ and Francis Bacon . Gaga is depicted as giving birth to a new race during a prologue . After a series of dance sequences , the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race . Critics noted the video 's references to the work of Madonna , Michael Jackson , Bj√∂rk , and the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen , as well as to Greek mythology and surrealism .   Gaga performed the song at the 53rd Grammy Awards after coming out of an incubating vessel . It was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and on television shows such as Saturday Night Live , Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve and Good Morning America . The song was treated with different remixes , including a `` Country Road '' version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo Salim-Sulaiman . Alice Cooper , Madonna , Katy Perry , Maria Aragon , and the cast of the TV series Glee have covered the song . ",SUPPORTS,"1. SUPPORTED

The term cult film was first used in the 1970s.,"
1. Assumed that the origin of cult film can be traced back to a specific time period.
2. Assumed that the usage of cult film predates the 1970s.
3. Assumed that the first usage of cult film was in the English language.
4. Assumed that the term was used in academic or popular discourse.
5. Assumed that the term has since gained wide acceptance in the film industry and academic fields.
6. Assumed that the term is applicable beyond the film industry, such as in other media industries.
7. Assumed that the term has remained relatively consistent in its definition over time. 
8. Assumed that the term is not influenced by regional, cultural, or social factors.","A cult film , also commonly referred to as a cult classic , is a film that has acquired a cult following . Cult films are known for their dedicated , passionate fanbase , an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings , quoting dialogue , and audience participation . Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions , especially box office bombs , while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure , transgressive films shunned by the mainstream . The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art . The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies , though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that .   Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and suppressed films kept alive by dedicated fans . In some cases , reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release , occasionally for their camp value . Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics ; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films . After failing in the cinema , some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video . Others have inspired their own film festivals . Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures . Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge .   Cult films frequently break cultural taboos , and many feature excessive displays of violence , gore , sexuality , profanity , or combinations thereof . This can lead to controversy , censorship , and outright bans ; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent . Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films . Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films ; fans of these films often emphasize the films ' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects . Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons , such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing , will often be ostracized or ridiculed . Likewise , fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection .   Since the late 1970s , cult films have become increasingly popular . Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream , and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture . Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy , as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional ; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic . Films are frequently stated to be an `` instant cult classic '' now , occasionally before they are released . Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release . At the same time , other films have acquired massive , quick cult followings , thanks to spreading virally through social media . Easy access to cult films via video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films . ",SUPPORTS,"1. Supported

    (7) The claim is made with the assumption that the existence of two major political parties is a necessary condition for any democratic society.
    (8) The claim is made with the assumption that there was a binary division of the American political landscape during the period in question.","The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active party .   The Democrats ' dominant worldview was once social conservativism and economic liberalism , while , especially in the rural South , populism was its leading characteristic . In 1912 , Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate in the Progressive -LRB- `` Bull Moose '' -RRB- Party , leading to a switch of political platforms between the Democratic and Republican Party and Woodrow Wilson being elected as the first fiscally progressive Democrat . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has also promoted a social-liberal platform , supporting social justice .   Today , the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists , with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats . The party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy . These interventions , such as the introduction of social programs , support for labor unions , affordable college tuitions , moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity , consumer protection , and environmental protection form the core of the party 's economic policy . The party has united with smaller liberal regional parties throughout the country , such as the Farmer -- Labor Party in Minnesota and the Nonpartisan League in North Dakota .   Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings . The New Deal Coalition of 1932 -- 1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction -- many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal of the 1930s , the pro-business wing withered outside the South . After the racial turmoil of the 1960s , most southern whites and many northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White Evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the state and local level in the 1990s . Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. such as -LRB- but not limited to -RRB- Jewish Americans , Hispanic Americans , Arabic Americans , and African Americans , tend to support the Democratic Party in proportions higher than their overall representation in American society . Overall , the Democratic Party has retained a membership lead over its major rival the Republican Party -LRB- GOP -RRB- .   15 Democrats have served as president under 16 administrations : the first was seventh president Andrew Jackson , who served from 1829 to 1837 ; Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897 , and is thus counted twice -LRB- as the 22nd and 24th president -RRB- . The most recent was the 44th president Barack Obama , who held the office from 2009 to 2017 .   In the 115th Congress , following the 2016 elections , Democrats are the opposition party , holding a minority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate .

It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon . The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small , simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period .   This period consists of the Paleocene , Eocene and Oligocene epochs . The end of the Paleocene -LRB- 55.5 / 54.8 Mya -RRB- was marked by the Paleocene -- Eocene Thermal Maximum , one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic , which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic foraminifera and on land , a major turnover in mammals . The terms ` Paleogene System ' -LRB- formal -RRB- and ` lower Tertiary System ' -LRB- informal -RRB- are applied to the rocks deposited during the ` Paleogene Period ' . The somewhat confusing terminology seems to be due to attempts to deal with the comparatively fine subdivisions of time possible in the relatively recent geologic past , for which more details are preserved . By dividing the Tertiary Period into two periods instead of directly into five epochs , the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of ` periods ' of the preceding Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras .

It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik , with a screenplay by Ross , Collins , and Billy Ray . The film stars Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam Hemsworth , Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks , Lenny Kravitz , Stanley Tucci , and Donald Sutherland . The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem , where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must take part in the Hunger Games , a televised annual event in which the `` tributes '' are required to fight to the death until there is only one survivor . Katniss Everdeen -LRB- Lawrence -RRB- volunteers to take her younger sister 's place . Joined by her district 's male tribute , Peeta Mellark -LRB- Hutcherson -RRB- , Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy -LRB- Harrelson -RRB- .   Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force , which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier . Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay . The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow . The main characters were cast between March and May 2011 . Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011 , with filming taking place in North Carolina . The Hunger Games was shot entirely on film as opposed to digital .   The film was released on March 21 , 2012 , in some European countries and in the US on March 23 , 2012 , in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters . Japan received it last , on September 28 . When the film released , it set records for opening day -LRB- $ 67.3 million -RRB- and opening weekend for a non-sequel . At the time of its release , the film 's opening weekend gross -LRB- $ 152.5 million -RRB- was the third-largest of any movie in North America . It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends . The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $ 694 million worldwide against its budget of $ 78 million , making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and ninth-highest-grossing worldwide of 2012 . It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 18 , 2012 . With 7,434,058 units sold , the DVD was the best-selling DVD of 2012 . A sequel , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , was released on November 22 , 2013 , in the United States .   The Hunger Games received positive reviews from critics , with praise for its themes and messages , as well as Jennifer Lawrence 's portrayal of Katniss , though there was criticism of the film 's use of shaky cam in the action sequences . Like the novel , the film has been noted for its similarities to other works , such as Robert Sheckley 's short story `` Seventh Victim '' and its Italian film adaptation The 10th Victim , the Japanese novel Battle Royale and its film adaptation , and the Shirley Jackson short story `` The Lottery '' , with some criticizing The Hunger Games for being derivative of such works . Collins stated in an interview that her novel and screenplay drew on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus , Roman gladiatorial games , reality television , and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war , not to think as just an audience member , `` Because those are real people on the screen , and they 're not going away when the commercials start to roll . '' The song `` Safe & Sound '' won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song .

    </ol>","Turkey -LRB- T√ºrkiye Cumhuriyeti -LSB- Ààty…æcije dÕ° íumÀàhu…æijeti -RSB- -RRB- , is a transcontinental country in Eurasia , mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia , with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe . Turkey is a democratic , secular , unitary , parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Turkey is bordered by eight countries : Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest ; Georgia to the northeast ; Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east ; Iraq and Syria to the south . The country is encircled by seas on three sides : the Aegean Sea is to the west , the Black Sea to the north , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . The Bosphorus , the Sea of Marmara , and the Dardanelles , which together form the Turkish Straits , divide Thrace and Anatolia ; they also separate Europe and Asia . Ankara is the capital while Istanbul is the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Approximately 70-80 % of the country 's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks . Other ethnic groups include legally recognised -LRB- Armenians , Greeks , Jews -RRB- and unrecognised -LRB- Kurds , Arabs , Circassians , Albanians , Bosniaks , Georgians , etc. -RRB- minorities . Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group , making up approximately 20 % of the population .   The area of Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations , as well as Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians and Armenians . After Alexander the Great 's conquest , the area was Hellenized , a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , starting the process of Turkification , which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . The Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks .   In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa , becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period . The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century , especially during the reign -LRB- 1520 -- 1566 -RRB- of Suleiman the Magnificent . It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries , until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe , signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth . After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'√©tat which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers . During the war , the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian , Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens .   Following the war , the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states . The Turkish War of Independence -LRB- 1919 -- 1922 -RRB- , initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk and his colleagues against the occupying Allies , resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 , with Atat√ºrk as its first president . Atat√ºrk enacted numerous reforms , many of which incorporated various aspects of Western thought , philosophy , and customs into the new form of Turkish government .   Turkey is a charter member of the UN , an early member of NATO , and a founding member of the OECD , OSCE , OIC and G-20 . After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 , Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963 , joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005 . Turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history .   Turkey 's current administration headed by president Tayyip Erdoƒüan has reversed many of the country 's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey , such as Freedom of the Press , a Legislative System of Checks and Balances , and a set of standards for secularism in government , as first enacted by Atat√ºrk .

This in turn helps students to develop more sophisticated and informed perspectives on the role of literature in society and in their own lives, which is a key goal of the course.","Unapologetic is the seventh studio album by Barbadian singer Rihanna .

Venom made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man # 300 -LRB- May 1988 -RRB- . Venom was originally conceived as a supervillain , but has since become more of an antihero . Venom is a Symbiote , a sentient alien , with a gooey , almost liquid-like form . As with real-world symbiotes , it requires a host , usually human , to bond with for its survival . After bonding , the Symbiote endows its enhanced powers upon the host . When the Venom Symbiote bonds with a human , that new dual-life form refers to itself as `` Venom '' .   The Venom Symbiote 's first known host was Spider-Man , who eventually separated himself from the creature when he discovered its true nature . The Symbiote went on to merge with other hosts , most notably Eddie Brock , its second and most infamous host , with whom it first became Venom and one of Spider-Man 's archenemies . According to S.H.I.E.L.D. , it is considered one of the greatest threats to humanity , alongside Magneto , Doctor Doom , and Red Skull .

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger -LRB- 1975 -RRB- and Stardust -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music . He was one of the main figures of outlaw country , a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound . Nelson has acted in over 30 films , co-authored several books , and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana .   Born during the Great Depression , and raised by his grandparents , Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten . During high school , he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player . After graduating from high school in 1950 , he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems . After his return , Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music . During this time , he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky-tonks . Nelson moved to Vancouver , Washington , where he wrote `` Family Bible '' and recorded the song `` Lumberjack '' in 1956 . In 1958 , he moved to Houston , Texas , after signing a contract with D Records . He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey . During that time , he wrote songs that would become country standards , including `` Funny How Time Slips Away '' , `` Hello Walls '' , `` Pretty Paper '' , and `` Crazy '' . In 1960 he moved to Nashville , Tennessee , and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price 's band as a bassist . In 1962 , he recorded his first album , ... And Then I Wrote . Due to this success , Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year . After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s , Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin , Texas . The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement , performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters .   In 1973 , after signing with Atlantic Records , Nelson turned to outlaw country , including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages . In 1975 , he switched to Columbia Records , where he recorded the critically acclaimed album Red Headed Stranger . The same year , he recorded another outlaw country album , Wanted ! The Outlaws , along with Waylon Jennings , Jessi Colter , and Tompall Glaser . During the mid-1980s , while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like `` On the Road Again '' , `` To All the Girls I 've Loved Before '' , and `` Pancho and Lefty '' , he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen , along with fellow singers Johnny Cash , Waylon Jennings , and Kris Kristofferson .   In 1990 , Nelson 's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service , which claimed that he owed . The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s . In 1992 , Nelson released The IRS Tapes : Who 'll Buy My Memories ? ; the profits of the double album -- destined to the IRS -- and the auction of Nelson 's assets cleared his debt . During the 1990s and 2000s , Nelson continued touring extensively , and released albums every year . Reviews ranged from positive to mixed . He explored genres such as reggae , blues , jazz , and folk . Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman , followed by other appearances in movies and on television .

Wyatt Earp became a constable by being appointed to the position by the local law enforcement agency. His specific duties included enforcing the law, maintaining order in the community, and protecting citizens from harm. He was responsible for apprehending criminals, maintaining records of arrests and convictions, and serving court documents. In addition, Wyatt Earp was often assigned duties that involved protecting local businesses or individuals from harm, and ensuring that local laws and regulations were followed. He was also responsible for conducting investigations and making arrests in cases of crimes such as theft, assault, and murder. Overall, Wyatt Earp's role as a constable was an important one in maintaining law and order in the communities where he lived and worked.","Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp -LRB- March 19 , 1848 -- January 13 , 1929 -RRB- was an American Old West gambler , a deputy sheriff in Pima County , and deputy town marshal in Tombstone , Arizona Territory , who took part in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral , during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys . He is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone , although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day , and had far more experience as a sheriff , constable , marshal , and soldier in combat .   Earp lived a restless life . He was at different times a constable , city policeman , county sheriff , Deputy U.S. Marshal , teamster , buffalo hunter , bouncer , saloon-keeper , gambler , brothel keeper , miner , and boxing referee . Earp spent his early life in Iowa . In 1870 , Earp married his first wife , Urilla Sutherland Earp , who contracted typhoid fever and died shortly before their first child was to be born . During the next two years Earp was arrested for stealing a horse , escaped from jail , sued twice , and was arrested and fined three times during the course of 1872 for `` keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame '' . His third arrest was subject of a lengthy account in the `` Daily Transcript '' which referred to him as an `` old offender '' and nicknamed him the `` Peoria Bummer '' .   By 1874 he had arrived in the cattle boomtown of Wichita , Kansas where his brother had opened a brothel . On April 21 , 1875 he was appointed to the Wichita police force , and developed a solid reputation as a lawman . In April 1876 he was dismissed from his position as a lawman following an altercation with a political opponent of his boss which led to him being fined $ 30 . In 1876 , he followed his brother James to Dodge City , Kansas , where he became an assistant city marshal . In winter 1878 , he went to Texas to track down an outlaw and met John `` Doc '' Holliday , whom Earp later credited with saving his life .   Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another . He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil , where a silver boom was underway . There , the Earps clashed with a loose federation of outlaws known as the Cowboys . Wyatt , Virgil , and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury , and Ike and Billy Clanton , who threatened on several occasions to kill the Earps . The conflict escalated over the next year , culminating on October 26 , 1881 in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral , in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the Cowboys . In the next five months , Virgil was ambushed and maimed , and Morgan was assassinated . Pursuing a vendetta , Wyatt , his brother Warren , Holliday , and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible . Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights in which he took part , unlike his brothers Virgil and James , or his friend , Doc Holliday , which only added to his mystique after his death .   Earp was a lifelong gambler and was always looking for a quick way to make money . After leaving Tombstone , Earp went to San Francisco where he reunited with Josephine Earp . She became his common-law wife . They joined a gold rush to Eagle City , Idaho , where they owned mining interests and a saloon . They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego , California . Back in San Francisco , Wyatt raced horses again , but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight . They moved briefly to Yuma , Arizona before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899 . In partnership with Charlie Hoxie they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $ 80,000 -LRB- about $ 2 million in 2017 dollars -RRB- . Returning to the lower 48 , they opened another saloon in Tonopah , Nevada , the site of a new gold find . In about 1911 , Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal , California , retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles .   Wyatt Earp died on January 13 , 1929 . He was known as a Western lawman , gunfighter , and boxing referee . He had a notorious reputation for both his handling of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight and his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight . This only began to change after his death when an extremely flattering biography was published in 1931 . It became a bestseller and created his reputation as a fearless lawman . Since then , Earp has been the subject of and model for numerous films , TV shows , biographies , and works of fiction that have increased his notoriety . He did , however , live to see himself being portrayed in the film Wild Bill Hickok , released in 1923 . Long after his death , he has many devoted detractors and admirers .

Wyoming is the least populous state in the United States.,"- Wyoming's population is less than 600,000.
    - Wyoming is not a metropolitan area.
    - Wyoming is not a densely populated state.
    - Wyoming has a low population density.
    - Wyoming's population is smaller than other states.
    - Wyoming's population size is comparable to cities or towns in other states.
    - Wyoming has a lower population compared to its land size.

2. Evaluate the accuracy of the claim and assumptions:
    - Wyoming has a population of about 579,000 people as of 2020, making it the least populated state in the US.
    - Wyoming is a rural state with small towns and a low population density. 
    - The assumption that Wyoming is not a metropolitan area is accurate since the state does not have any metropolitan area.
    - The assumptions that Wyoming has a low population density and a lower population compared to its land size are accurate since Wyoming has an average population density of 5.8 people per square mile, which is the second-lowest after Alaska. 
    - The assumption that Wyoming's population is smaller than other states is accurate since Wyoming has the second-lowest population of all US states. 
    - The assumption that other states have a larger population size than Wyoming may not be accurate, as it depends on the definition of ""larger"" and the data used. However, the claim that Wyoming is the least populous state is still accurate based on the data provided.

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter . His mythologies and powers are similar , though not identical , to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra , Jupiter , Perun , Thor , and Odin .   Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea , the youngest of his siblings to be born , though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus 's stomach . In most traditions , he is married to Hera , by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares , Hebe , and Hephaestus . At the oracle of Dodona , his consort was said to be Dione , by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite . Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades . These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring , including Athena , Apollo , Artemis , Hermes , Persephone , Dionysus , Perseus , Heracles , Helen of Troy , Minos , and the Muses .   He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles : `` Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father , and all the gods rise in his presence . '' He was equated with many foreign weather gods , permitting Pausanias to observe `` That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men '' .
